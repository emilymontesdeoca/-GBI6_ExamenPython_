TI  - Extremity Exercise Program in Breast Cancer Survivors Suffering from Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Feasibility Pilot Study.
LID - 688 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10040688 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of implementation of an extremity exercise program and to examine its preliminary effects in breast cancer survivors suffering from chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). SAMPLE & SETTING: Thirteen breast cancer survivors from one hospital in northern  Taiwan. Methods and Variables: A single group with repeated measures, and a quasi-experimental design. The intervention program was a four week, home-based extremity exercise program that was comprised of 10 skilled hand exercises and Buerger-Allen exercises. The Total Neuropathy Scale (clinical version), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group, Neurotoxicity (13-Item Version), Identification Pain Questionnaire, and pain Visual Analogue Scale were used to measure CIPN before exercise (T1), during (T2~T4), and after exercise (T5). Qualitative data were also collected at each time point. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, generalized estimating equations, and directed content analysis. RESULTS: None of the participants reported adverse events during the study period. The extremity exercise program significantly improved patient-reported CIPN after intervention at T4 or T5 but was insignificant on clinician-assessed CIPN. The qualitative data of participant experience indicated that this program is feasible and easy to follow. CONCLUSION: The extremity exercise program is feasible but needs to increase the  sample size and prolong the intervention period for confirmation.

PG  - 29-36
LID - 10.3400/avd.oa.21-00142 [doi]
AB  - Reports of vascular lesion changes in elderly Buerger disease patients are rare.  Patients are expected to continue to have typical Buerger disease even after the  age of 50. However, after 50, when patients suffer from atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia, what kind of changes will occur? We will report on 3 cases of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyper lipidemia after or around 50 years of age. As a result, atherosclerosis  was present in the iliac or aortic regions in the remaining thromboangiitis lesions below the groin area. (This is secondary publication from the J Jpn Coll  Angiol 2021; 61: 107-113.).

AB  - Introduction: Buerger disease, or thromboangiitis obliterans, is an inflammatory  and occlusive process involving small and medium size arteries and veins, which generally affects the lower limbs of young adult male with the habit of smoking.  Case Presentation: This paper reports 2 patients who developed nail lesions as the first sign of Buerger disease. Conclusion: Signs and symptoms of Buerger's disease are secondary to the inflammatory process and arterial occlusion which results in severe ischemia. Involvement of nails is not common, but we found 2 different clinical features which have not been previously reported in the literature: chronic paronychia, and proximal leukonychia or onycholysis and nail  bed erosion.

TI  - Buerger's Disease May be a Chronic Rickettsial Infection with Superimposed Thrombosis: Literature Review and Efficacy of Doxycycline in Three Patients.
PG  - 20-58
LID - 10.3947/ic.2021.0146 [doi]
AB  - Buerger's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis of unknown etiology.  The infectious etiology of BD was proposed by Buerger in 1914. Furthermore, there are scattered reports insisting that BD may be related to rickettsial infection,  first asserted by Goodman since 1916, followed by Giroud and other French investigators from the 1940s through the 1960s, Nicolau in the 1960s, Bartolo (1980s), and Fazeli (2010s). However, their causal relationship has hardly been accepted because rickettsial infections are known to be acute febrile, vector-borne illnesses, whereas BD is a chronic afebrile illness. In this article we review the relevant literature on the chronic nature of Rickettsia and Orientia infections and on the rickettsial etiology of BD. Excellent initial responses to doxycycline in three patients with BD are briefly described. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that BD patients acquired a rickettsial infection far before the onset of BD. Over years, the infected area expands to become a segment of the infected vessel. Subsequently, thrombus develops on the luminal surface of the infected endothelial cells, which produces the vascular obstructive manifestations of BD. Collectively, it is postulated that BD is a chronic infection with a member of the family Rickettsiaceae with superimposed thrombosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The famous Brazilian Baroque sculptor named Antonio Francisco Lisboa, known as "Aleijadinho" (1738-1814), suffered from a deforming disease of the lower and upper limbs. The condition was characterized by atrophy, paresis and amputation. His face was also affected, with inflammation of the eyelids, deviation of the labial commissure, drooping of the chin and lower lip, giving him a sinister expression. Despite the disabling and chronic illness, he produced several works of great expression in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of them were declared World Heritage Sites by United Nations Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization (UNESCO). OBJECTIVE: To discuss the historical differential diagnosis of Aleijadinho's disease through a narrative review of the literature.  METHODS: Scientific articles were searched in databases such as Google Scholar, Pubmed and Lilacs using the term "Aleijadinho". Subsequently, data were collected in articles and books about the possible diseases of the sculptor. RESULTS: Since the first clinical report on the sculptor, several historians and doctors have attempted to establish a diagnosis and several hypotheses have been proposed such as: syphilis, yaws (frambesia tropica), rheumatoid arthritis, Hansen's disease (leprosy), thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease), zamparina, cardina, porphyria cutanea tarda, stroke, amyloidosis, trauma and/or scurvy. CONCLUSIONS:  Based on the literature, the authors conclude that the most likely diagnosis of Aleijadinho's disease is consistent with leprosy.

LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11101736 [doi]
AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) or Buerger's disease is a segmental inflammatory, thrombotic occlusive peripheral vascular disease with unknown aetiology that usually involves the medium and small-sized vessels of young male  smokers. Due to its unknown aetiology and similarities with atherosclerosis and vasculitis, TAO diagnosis is still challenging. We aimed to review the status of  biomolecular and laboratory para-clinical markers in TAO compared to atherosclerosis and vasculitis. We reported that, although some biomarkers might  be common in TAO, atherosclerosis, and vasculitis, each disease occurs through a  different pathway and, to our knowledge, there is no specific and definitive marker for differentiating TAO from atherosclerosis or vasculitis. Our review highlighted that pro-inflammatory and cell-mediated immunity cytokines, IL-33, HMGB1, neopterin, MMPs, ICAM1, complement components, fibrinogen, oxidative stress, NO levels, eNOS polymorphism, adrenalin and noradrenalin, lead, cadmium,  and homocysteine are common markers. Nitric oxide, MPV, TLRs, MDA, ox-LDL, sST2,  antioxidant system, autoantibodies, and type of infection are differential markers, whereas platelet and leukocyte count, haemoglobin, lipid profile, CRP, ESR, FBS, creatinine, d-dimer, hypercoagulation activity, as well as protein C and S are controversial markers. Finally, our study proposed diagnostic panels for laboratory differential diagnosis to be considered at first and in more advanced stages.

LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.105701 [doi]
AB  - Here we propose an NPT metadynamics simulation scheme for pressure-induced structural phase transitions, using coordination number and volume as collective  variables, and apply it to the reconstructive structural transformation B1-B2 in  NaCl. By studying systems with size up to 64 000 atoms we reach a regime beyond collective mechanism and observe transformations proceeding via nucleation and growth. We also reveal the crossover of the transition mechanism from Buerger-like for smaller systems to Watanabe-Toledano for larger ones. The scheme is likely to be applicable to a broader class of pressure-induced structural transitions, allowing study of complex nucleation effects and bringing simulations closer to realistic conditions.

TI  - Development and Comparative Efficacy of Lagos Neuropathy Protocol for Improving Recovery of Symptom and Functional Independence Performance in Individuals with Diabetic Peripheral Sensorimotor Polyneuropathy.
PG  - 136-144
LID - 10.1298/ptr.E10070 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic peripheral sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DPSP) has been treated with sketchy outcomes and available approaches are not applicable for self-administration. This study developed protocol for managing symptoms of DPSP  and assessed its comparative efficacy. METHODS: Study developed Lagos Neuropathy  Protocol (LNP) through existing concept in DPSP and tested its safety, clinical applicability, and ease of self-administration. Its efficacy was compared with Buerger-Allen Exercise (BAE) by involving 31(11males) with DPSP, randomized into  LNP and BAE and treated for 10-week. Toronto Clinical Scoring System was used to  diagnose DPSP while Diabetic Neuropathy Examination was used to diagnose distal polyneuropathy. Sensory/pressure perception was assessed using 10 g-monofilament  while Short Physical Performance Battery, Bergs Balance Scale and Visual Analogue Scale was used to assess functional performance, strength and balance, and pain respectively. RESULTS: LNP has three domains: sensory/pressure/proprioception, strength/balance, and pain/swelling. Most (80%) of the participants rated the LNP as excellently safe while the rest (20%) rated as very good in safety. All the participants rated LNP excellent in terms of self-administration and suitability  for clinical use without adverse effect. The mean age of the participants for the comparative phase was 66.20+/-9.48years while their length of diagnoses of diabetes was 15.80+/-13.35years. About a third (32.5%) had DPSP. Both LNP and BAE had significant improvement (p<0.05) in sensory/pressure perception, pain, strength and balance, and functional performance but LNP had better significant improvement. CONCLUSION: LNP is safe, good for self-administration, clinically applicable and efficacious in improving sensory/pressure perception, balance, pain and functional performances in individuals with DPSP.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO, Buerger disease) is a segmental, non-atherosclerotic vasculitis that causes occlusion of the small and medium sized vessels of the distal extremities. In rare cases, it can affect vessels in  the gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, coronary, and renal systems. The etiology  of thromboangiitis obliterans is unknown, but there is a strong association with  smoking in the development and the progression of the disease. We present the case of a 42-year-old homeless female smoker, who was found dead outdoors. Although originally suspected to be a possible trauma-related death, autopsy revealed a thrombus in her left carotid artery, which caused an acute cerebral infarction. It was concluded that thromboangiitis obliterans, likely precipitated by smoking, was the cause of the thrombosis and subsequent death.

TI  - Endovascular Treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia in Buerger Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans) With Midterm Follow-Up: A Viable Option When Bypass  Surgery Is Not Feasible.
PG  - 421-427
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.23023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is an occlusive inflammatory disease  affecting small- and medium-sized vessels that causes decrease in life quality and eventually limb loss. The only proven treatment method is smoking cessation,  but it may be insufficient for limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia. In this single-center retrospective study, the feasibility and efficiency of endovascular treatment in TAO were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS. After approval of the local institutional review board, 41 patients who  underwent endovascular treatment of TAO between January 2014 and June 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. Technical success and procedure-related complications  were recorded. Decrease in Rutherford classification score, relief of pain, and wound healing were evaluated to determine clinical success. Primary patency, limb salvage rate, and amputation-free survival were also evaluated. RESULTS. A total  of 45 limbs were treated during the study period. Technical success was achieved  in 82.2% of procedures. Mean follow-up was 29.8 months. Clinical improvement was  achieved in 35 limbs. Three patients underwent major amputation and 12 patients underwent minor amputation. Amputation-free survival and limb salvage were both 93.3% at both 1 and 2 years. Reintervention was performed in 14 patients because  of occlusion and clinical relapsing of the symptoms. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment of TAO is feasible, has a potential to prevent limb amputation in patients with critical limb ischemia, and has acceptable technical success and limb salvage rates. Because there is no consensus in treatment of TAO, prospective comparative studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of an endovascular approach.

TI  - Effectiveness of Buerger-Allen Exercise on Lower Extremity Perfusion and Peripheral Neuropathy Symptoms among Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 291-295
LID - 10.4103/ijnmr.IJNMR_63_19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Buerger-Allen Exercise (BAE) promote Lower Extremity Perfusion (LEP)  via the wound healing process and reduce Peripheral Neuropathy Symptoms (PNS) among Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients. We study the efficacy of BAE on LEP and PNS among patients with DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental study  was conducted prospectively from July to October 2017. Fifty DM patients between  the ages of 30 and 75 from both genders were selected using a purposive sampling  technique and were assessed for LEP with a manual Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) scale and assessed for PNS with Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI).  The BAE was demonstrated for 4 consecutive days. The intervention was repeated five times per day for each patient and the posttest was conducted 5(th) day using the same tools. RESULTS: The majority (n = 75, 75%) were 60-69 age group and 98% had education till primary school. 62% had diabetes and 20% of them had a history of peripheral arterial disease. 50% of participants had mildly impaired perfusion during pretest whereas abnormal neuropathy was seen in more than 70% cases which decreased posttest. A significant difference in PNS was seen after the implementation of BAE in both right LEP (t48 = 6.81, p < 0.001) and left LEP  t48= 5.21, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: BAE has to be taught to the patients with DM  in improving the level of LEP and can be encouraged to practice in the hospital and home care setup.

TI  - Infrainguinal Occlusive Disease
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Infrainguinal occlusive diseases are one of the commonest diseases faced by patients worldwide. The comorbidities, and atherosclerotic etiology of most, result in an increased chance of limb loss, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications.[1] They may also be known as arterial occlusive disease or chronic limb ischemia. Some of the less common diseases which cause lower extremity arterial insufficiency symptoms are atheroembolism and Buerger disease. Arterial  occlusive diseases produce signs and symptoms based on the site of artery stenosis or occlusion. In the lower limb, the most common symptoms are intermittent claudication, rest pain, and gangrene. These are classified according to different stages, using various established classifications, including Fontaine, Rutherford, Wagner, UT, PEDIS, SVS WIfI.[2] The arteries involved are mainly those inferior to the inguinal ligament, which include, Femoral artery branch of the external iliac artery. Popliteal artery. Infrapopliteal arteries, including posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery.

PG  - 2050312120927636
LID - 10.1177/2050312120927636 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thromboangiitis obliterans is an inflammatory disease affecting both  medium- and small-sized vessels. Vasodilators, antiplatelets were proposed for treatment but the effect was minimal. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of balloon angioplasty on patients with Buerger's disease  compared to medical treatment. METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2016, 82 patients with Buerger's disease were enrolled in the study, of whom 52 were randomized to the aggressive endovascular intervention and 30 were randomized medically by cilostazol and aspirin as a control group. In all, 23% of the patients presented with severe claudication, 50% with ischemic rest pain and 27%  with ischemic ulcers. Randomization was done using the opaque envelope method. Allocation concealment was maintained to ensure no selection bias. Patient groups were compared for the duration of ulcer healing, ankle-brachial index, peak systolic velocity changes and transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2) level for 30 months. RESULTS: No major procedural complications occurred in the endovascular group. Angiographic success was achieved in 100% of supragenicular lesions but in 90% of infrapopliteal lesions. The endovascular group showed a statistically significant improvement in the ulcer healing size and duration at 6 months after  the procedure with a mean time of 3 +/- 0.9 months compared to 5.8 +/- 1.69 months for the medical treatment group (p < 0.001), the mean TcPO2 from 27.23 +/- 16.75 mm Hg (range: 0-56 mm Hg) before the procedure to 71.32 +/- 12.94 mm Hg (range: 52-92 mm Hg) following revascularization (p < 0.01). The mean ankle-brachial index significantly improved from 0.54 +/- 0.14 preoperatively to  0.82 +/- 0.08 at final follow-up (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The endovascular therapy should be considered as an effective, safe, minimally invasive method in the light of the promising results after a modification of the standard technique.

TI  - [Lower limb ischemia cured by stimulation electrode implantation assisted with microendoscopic discectomy system: A case report].
PG  - 378-381
AB  - A 58-year-old male patient diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans (Fontaine stage IV) was recently treated with microendoscope discectomy system-assisted spinal cord stimulation electrode implantation and cured by department of vascular surgery combined with department of spinal surgery at Peking University  People's Hospital. The patient suffered from cold injury to the right foot 14 years ago, which was cold, painful, numb, and then the toe was ulcerated and gangrene. Only the right foot small toe was left. The right foot skin was swollen from the toe to the proximal segment 1 year ago, accompanied by resting pain. Both pain and autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation were ineffective.  The above symptoms were aggravated three months ago, and the pain was severe. The visual analogue score was 10 points. A high amputation of the left lower extremity was performed 30 years ago due to trauma. Physical examination: the bilateral femoral artery was weak, and the right radial artery, posterior tibial  artery, and dorsal artery were not touched. Buerger sign (+). Auxiliary examination: angiography of both lower extremities showed complete occlusion of the bilateral external iliac artery and its distal end. The percutaneous oxygen partial pressure was measured to be 30 mmHg on the right side of the iliac crest. The operation was performed under the local anesthesia. After X-ray positioning,  the body projection of the lumbar vertebrae 1-2 lamina gap was marked. The skin had a 1.8 cm incision on the caudal side 2 cm from the mark. Then the dilators were used, and the working sleeve was tilted to the lumbar vertebrae 1-2 lamina gap. The microendoscope discectomy system was installed, the electrode was directly placed into the epidural space from the interlamina space under the microendoscope, the vascular surgeon adjusted the position of the electrode in the spinal canal under fluoroscopy, then connected the stimulator, adjusted the current until the patient had the lower limb fever, fixed electrode position, removed the microendoscope discectomy system after hemostasis under the microendoscope, used the guide needle to lead the electrode through the lumbar subcutaneous and then sutured the incision. After the operation, the electrode was connected to the temporary stimulator to stimulate for several minutes, the patient felt numbness in his lower limbs. In less than one hour, the skin temperature of the affected limb increased, and the painkiller could be stopped while sleeping. After 1 week, the skin temperature of the affected limb increased, and the percutaneous oxygen partial pressure of the foot and ankle was 36 mmHg, and the pain improved, and the score was reduced to 2 points. One month  after surgery, the patient underwent permanent stimulator implantation. The pain  disappeared after 3 months and half year of follow-up, and the score was reduced  to 1 point. Microendoscope discectomy system-assisted spinal cord stimulation electrode implantation can complete the operation quickly, safely and effectively, and greatly reduce the number of intraoperative fluoroscopy and reduce the occurrence of complications.

TI  - The Imbalance among Oxidative Biomarkers and Antioxidant Defense Systems in Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Winiwarter-Buerger Disease).
LID - E1036 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9041036 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Thromboangiitis obliterans or Winiwarter-Buerger disease (WBD), is an inflammatory, thrombotic occlusive, peripheral vascular disease, usually occurring in young smokers. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease are not clearly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants occurring in these patients. (2) Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 22 male patients with WBD and 20 healthy male smoking habit matched control group were included. To evaluate the possible sources of oxidative stress, the antioxidant biomarkers, and the markers of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, serum samples were analyzed for total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), myeloperoxidase (MPO), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein carbonyl (PC) activity and/or content. (3) Results: The circulating levels of TOS, TAC, and CoQ10 were significantly higher in WBD patients, with respect to healthy smokers  as controls. No significant difference was found among the serum level of PC, total cholesterol, MPO, and GR activity in WBD patients and healthy smoker controls. The activity of SOD and the mean serum level of MDA were significantly  lower in WBD patients, with respect to healthy smoker controls. (4) Conclusion: Considerably high levels of oxidative stress were detected in WBD patients, which were greater than the antioxidant capacity. The low level of MDA may be associated with the enzymatic degradation of lipid peroxidation products. High levels of CoQ10 and low levels of SOD may be related to a harmful oxidative cooperation, leading to the vasoconstriction of WBD, representing a promising tool to discern possible different clinical risks of this poorly understood peripheral occlusive disease.

TI  - Intra-arterial thrombolysis in acute popliteal artery occlusion is a safe and effective technique reducing the rate of open surgery.
PG  - 745-751
LID - 10.23736/S0021-9509.20.11121-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute popliteal artery occlusion is a frequent clinical entity with a risk of major amputation. Several attitudes are possible and treatment is not standardized. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of intra-arterial thrombolysis in acute popliteal artery occlusion. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients treated by intra-arterial thrombolysis for acute lower-limb ischemia due to popliteal artery occlusion between 2001 and 2014.The primary endpoint was technical and clinical success. Etiologies and etiologic treatment, amputation-free survival, in-hospital mortality and bleeding complications rates  were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients, with a mean 6-day-old ischemic time before thrombolysis, were analyzed. Technical and clinical success  was 90% and 87% respectively. Etiology was embolic in 33 patients (cardiac N.=14, aortic=6, unknown=13) and thrombotic in 38 (atheromatous N.=19, entrapment N.= 4, popliteal aneurysm N.=11, Buerger N.=2, thrombophilia N.=1, hyperhomocysteinemia  N.=1). Survival and amputation-free survival at 30 days were 97% and 94% respectively. There were no major bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-arterial thrombolysis of acute popliteal artery occlusion is an effective technique which reduces the rate of open surgery. The risk of bleeding complications is very low.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with severe Buerger disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), are at risk of major limb amputation. It has been shown that autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) implantation improves the condition of critical limb ischemia in TAO patients. This study was conducted to  further clarify the long-term (>10 years) results of autologous BM-MNC implantation in patients with TAO.Methods and Results:An observational study was  conducted of the long-term results of BM-MNC implantation in 47 lower limbs of 27 patients with TAO. The mean (+/-SD) follow-up period was 12.0+/-8.6 years. There  was no major amputation event up to 10 years of follow-up in patients treated with BM-MNC implantation. The overall amputation-free survival rates were significantly higher in patients who underwent BM-MNC implantation than in internal controls and historical controls. There was no significant difference in amputation-free survival rates between the historical and internal controls. There was also no significant difference in overall survival between patients who underwent BM-MNC implantation and the historical controls. CONCLUSIONS: BM-MNC transplantation successfully prevented major limb amputation over a period of >10 years in patients with severe TAO who had no other therapeutic options.

LID - 10.4103/0970-258X.278685 [doi]
AB  - Background: Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) or Buerger disease is a recurring progressive segmental vasculopathy that presents with inflammation and thrombosis of small and medium arteries and veins of the hands and feet. The exact cause remains unknown, with tobacco use (primarily smoking but also smokeless tobacco)  being highly associated with the disease. The diagnosis is clinical and the lack  of a diagnostic gold standard is a deterrent to diagnosing it in patients with atypical presentations. Obliterative endarteritis occurs perhaps due to a mixture of thrombosis and inflammation. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer as a biomarker for thrombosis is well reported from its use in other areas such as deep vein thrombosis. Identification of a biomarker linked to the causation yields a diagnostic adjunct with a role in therapeutic decision-making, aiding diagnosis in atypical presentation, monitoring disease activity and gauging response to therapy. Methods: Between April 2014 and May 2015, we studied serum D-dimer (a marker of thrombosis) in 62 patients with TAO and compared this  to 330 normal age- and sex-matched controls. We included all patients with peripheral arterial disease clinically diagnosed to have TAO according to the Shionoya criteria. There was no history of thrombosis or arterial disease in the  control group. The control group was matched for baseline characteristics such as age and sex. All patients underwent a standard diagnostic protocol including blood tests (haemoglobin and creatinine), electrocardiogram, chest X-ray and ankle brachial pressure index. Blood was collected using an evacuated tube system into a citrate anticoagulant tube for testing D-dimer. Results: All the 62 patients diagnosed to have TAO were men with an average age of 40 years (range 18-65 years). They all had a history of tobacco use and did not have other atherogenic risk factors (part of the diagnostic criteria). Medium-vessel involvement was present in 53 patients (85%) and the rest presented with additional involvement of the popliteal and femoral vessels. Upper limb involvement or superficial thrombophlebitis was present in 95% of patients. Laboratory and imaging studies were consistent with TAO. The groups were well matched for age (p = 0.3). The median and interquartile range for D-dimer values  were 61 ng/ml and 41-88 ng/ml in controls (n = 330) and 247 ng/ml and 126478 ng/ml in patients (n = 62), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions: D-dimer levels are considerably elevated in patients with TAO. This indicates an underlying thrombotic process and suggests its potential role as a diagnostic adjunct. It also leads us to hypothesize a potential therapeutic benefit of anticoagulants in this disease.

TI  - Using Wireless Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to Predict Wound Prognosis in Diabetic  Foot Ulcers.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use wearable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the effect of Buerger exercises on diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing. METHODS: Study  authors enrolled 50 consecutive patients in a 1-year prospective observational study of DFUs. The patients were divided into groups by their arterial statuses:  group A (no peripheral arterial disease [PAD]), group B (PAD without angioplasty), and group C (PAD with angioplasty). Tissue perfusion was assessed through wireless wearable NIRS to determine the effects of Buerger exercises on wound healing. MAIN RESULTS: The patients in group C were older, were more likely to have had an amputation, and had more severe wounds than did the patients in other groups. The requirements of insulin injection for diabetes mellitus control differed significantly (P = .024) among the three groups. At the end of the survey, 19 patients (38%) had unhealed DFUs. The NIRS revealed that most nonhealed patients in groups B and C shared higher resting hemoglobin levels and  tissue blood volume and lower tissue oxygen concentration, which indicated inflammation accompanied by higher blood flow and oxygen consumption. Notably, the nonhealed patients in group C showed paradoxically reduced hemoglobin and tissue blood volume after the exercises. CONCLUSIONS: Although DFUs remain a challenge to treat, NIRS may prove valuable in predicting wound healing by identifying risk factors for poor wound prognosis, such as reduced hemoglobin and tissue blood volume after exercise.

TI  - How to use clinical signs and symptoms to estimate the probability of limb ischaemia in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer.
PG  - e3241
LID - 10.1002/dmrr.3241 [doi]
AB  - Assessment of ischaemia and interventions to improve perfusion are key elements in the management of the diabetic foot ulcer to achieve wound healing. This article will review, analyse and interpret the value of clinical information in determining the likelihood of limb ischaemia and thereby the need for referral to a vascular specialist. I conducted an historical review of the genesis of several currently recommended clinical signs and their diagnostic properties in the assessment of limb ischaemia. Changes in limb ischaemia probability based on such results were calculated using Bayes theorem, and the use of such probabilities is discussed in the context of the threshold approach to clinical decision making. Some clinical signs have negligible value in altering probability of limb ischaemia, possibly because they were advocated by Buerger for the diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans, an occlusive vascular disease of a different pathophysiology than atherosclerosis. Pedal pulse palpation, the most widely studied clinical sign, will marginally change a pre-test probability of ischaemia of 50% to 76% if positive (abnormal pulses) and to 36% if negative (normal pulses). Higher or lower pre-test probabilities of ischaemia will change the post-test probabilities such that these are too low or high to rule in or rule out ischaemia, respectively. Individual clinical signs convey little information  regarding the presence of limb ischaemia but may have some value in combination or with pre-test probability near 50% in the assessment of ischaemia and the decision to refer for a vascular consultation.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, is a rare nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory vasculitis that generally affects young tobacco smokers. Although no surgical treatment is available, the most effective way to halt the disease's progress is smoking cessation. In this case report, a 29-year-old smoker showed up to emergency department with gangrene of his fifth left toe and  extensive plantar ulceration. After investigative angiography, he was diagnosed with Buerger disease. On November 2017, he underwent fifth left toe amputation and hyperbaric therapy. Five months after amputation, the patient was rehospitalized because of surgical wound dehiscence, wide ulceration, and pain. He was treated with lipofilling using the Coleman technique. Two weeks after the  fat grafting procedure, the patient suspended pain control medication, and after  2 months, the surgical wound was almost healed. Fat grafting (lipofilling) is mostly used in plastic surgery; it offers regenerative effects, with minimal discomfort for the patient. This case report demonstrates a successful alternative use of lipofilling for this unique condition and opens up new options for use of this technique in other fields.

TI  - Major lower extremity amputation: a contemporary analysis from an academic tertiary referral centre in a developing community.
PG  - 170
LID - 10.1186/s12893-019-0637-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore the surgical outcomes of major lower extremity amputation (MLEA) and influencing factors at an academic tertiary referral centre in north Jordan, optimistically providing a platform for future health care policies and initiatives to improve the outcomes of MLEA in Jordan. METHODS: Clinical records of patients who had undergone MLEA between January 2012 and December 2017 were identified and retrospectively reviewed. International Classification of Diseases codes were used to identify the study cohort from a prospectively maintained computerised database. We included adult patients of both genders who underwent amputations for ischemic lower limb (acute and chronic) and diabetic foot syndrome (DFS). We excluded patients for whom MLEA surgery was performed for other indications (trauma and tumors). Outcomes of interest included patient demographics and comorbidities, type of amputation and  indications, length of hospital stay (LOS), the need for revision surgery (ipsilateral conversion to a higher level of amputation), and cumulative mortality rate at 1 year. The impact of the operating surgeon's specialty (vascular vs. non-vascular surgeon) on outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 140 patients who underwent MLEA (110 below-knee amputations [BKA] and 30 above-knee amputations [AKA]; ratio: 3:1; 86 men; 54 women; mean age, 62.9 +/- 1.1 years). Comorbidities included diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney  disease, stroke, and Buerger disease. The only associated comorbidity was chronic kidney disease, which was more prevalent among BKA patients (p = 0.047). Indications for MLEA included DFS, and lower limb ischaemia. Acute limb ischaemia was more likely to be an indication for AKA (p = 0.006). LOS was considerably longer for AKA (p = 0.035). The cumulative mortality rate at 1 year was 30.7%. Revision surgery rates and LOS improved significantly with increased rate of vascular surgeon-led MLEA. CONCLUSIONS: In developing countries, the adverse impact of MLEA is increased because of limited resources and increased prevalence of diabetes-related foot complications. Vascular surgeon-led MLEA is associated with decreased revision rates, LOS and possibly improved outcomes, particularly when it is performed for vascular insufficiency. It is important to formulate national health care policies to improve patient outcomes in these countries.

TI  - Medical adjunctive therapy for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia: a systematic review.
PG  - 642-651

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this article is to systematically review the literature  on medical adjunctive therapy for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies published between January 1st, 2009, and June 1st, 2019. Articles that studied medical treatment of CLTI patients and  reported clinical outcomes were eligible. Main exclusion criteria were case reports <20 patients, incorrect publication type, and CLTI caused by Buerger disease. The primary end point was major amputation (above the ankle) in studies  with a follow-up of >/=6 months. Secondary end points were other clinical end points such as death and wound healing. Study quality was assessed according to the Downs and Black checklist. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Included were 42 articles: four focused on antiplatelet therapy, five on antihypertensive medication, 6 on lipid-lowering therapy, 16 on stem cell therapy, three on growth factors, five on prostanoids, and one study each on cilostazol, glucose-lowering therapy, spinal cord stimulation, sulodexide, and hemodilution. Calcium channel blockers, iloprost, cilostazol, and hemodilution showed significant improvement of limb salvage, but data are limited. Stem cell therapy showed no significant improvement of limb salvage but could potentially improve wound healing. Antiplatelets, antihypertensives, and statins showed significantly lower cardiovascular events rates but not evident lower major amputation rates. The quality of the studies was fair to good. CONCLUSIONS: Certain medical therapies serve to improve limb salvage next to revascularization in CLTI patients, whereas others are important in secondary prevention. Because high quality evidence is limited, further research is needed.

TI  - Case report of two pregnancies and deliveries by a woman with Buerger disease.
PG  - 2100-2104
LID - 10.1111/jog.14087 [doi]
AB  - Buerger disease is a chronic inflammatory disease that involves blood clot formation in the medium and small arteries, resulting in thrombophlebitis. It is  usually observed in middle-aged men who smoke and is very rare in young women. Previous reports have indicated that Buerger disease worsens during pregnancy due to hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy, and newborns' birth weights were often lower than normal. This report describes a young woman with Buerger disease who experienced two pregnancies and deliveries. During the 1st pregnancy, d-dimer and soluble fibrin levels slightly increased, but no treatment was needed. However, during the 2nd pregnancy, d-dimer and soluble fibrin levels abruptly increased at 20 weeks of pregnancy, and heparin was administered subcutaneously.  Four days after heparin administration, d-dimer and soluble fibrin levels decreased to normal pregnancy levels. d-dimer and soluble fibrin measurements were useful for evaluating the coagulation tendencies of this pregnant woman with Buerger disease.

TI  - Performance of noninvasive laser Doppler flowmetry and laser speckle contrast imaging methods in diagnosis of Buerger disease: A case report.
PG  - e12979
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000012979 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Buerger disease (BD) is a nonatherosclerotic, inflammatory, segmental  vascular occlusive disease, which affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins and is triggered by substantial tobacco exposure. Angiographic findings consistent with BD are required for diagnosis. Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and  laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) could represent potential noninvasive alternative techniques to angiography. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report the case of a  49-year-old smoker who developed an ischemic ulcer in the distal segment of the second finger of the left hand. He had no medical history. DIAGNOSES: In our vascular center, LDF and LSCI are conducted routinely for digital artery disease  diagnosis. LDF was indicative of digital obstructive artery disease (DOAD). Postocclusive reactive hyperemia, assessed by LCSI, demonstrated no skin blood flow (SBF) perfusion in the distal phalanx of the thumb, index, middle, and auricular fingers. Angiography confirmed BD, showing distally located multisegmental vessel occlusion and corkscrew collaterals in this patient's hands. INTERVENTIONS: Ilomedine treatment was initiated and smoking cessation was definitive. OUTCOMES: Recently, the patient had an improvement in clinical condition despite the persistence of a small zone of necrosis of the left index finger 28 days post-treatment. LESSONS: Our observation suggests that where suspicion of BD is based on clinical criteria, combining LDF and LSCI could represent a noninvasive, safe means of reaching BD diagnosis. Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm this novel observation.

AB  - Buerger disease is a rare peripheral vascular disease that most frequently affects young men and is strongly correlated with tobacco use. Although several options have been suggested, no consensus exists on the management of patients with Buerger disease except for smoking cessation. Revascularization is sometimes required to salvage ischemic limbs; however, it is often not feasible because of  a lack of distal target vessels. Herein, we present the cases of three patients with tissue loss and gangrene due to Buerger disease. These patients underwent dorsal metatarsal artery bypass and avoided amputation.

AB  - Digital ulcers generally arise in a context of microangiopathy-related focal ischemia. In women, connective tissue diseases are the main etiology, while in men the cause is often diffuse arterial disease, e.g. Leo-Buerger disease, or emboligenic heart disease. A paraneoplastic origin of digital necrosis due to ischemia is rarely reported. A 75-year-old man presented with cyanosis of the fingertips and toes that had begun one month earlier. The physical examination found pulp ulcers on the fingers and toes of both hands and feet. Two weeks later, necrotic damage developed distally, with no other associated symptoms. Blood tests were suggestive of Kahler disease; immunodeficiency disorders tests were negative; the cyroglobulin test was positive. Multiple-drug chemotherapy was followed by clinical improvement. Distal necrotic damage is a frequent inaugural  symptom in vascular disease. If the common causal mechanisms (iatrogenic, occupational, toxic, atheromatous, emboligenic heart disease, or systemic disease) have been ruled out, it is important to search for a blood disorder or cancer as the cause of distal necrotic damage.

AB  - CLINICAL CASE: A 27-year-old male with sudden visual loss of OD. He had a past history of heavy smoking, as well as a chronic ischaemia of his left lower limb of one-year onset. This led to a diagnosis of Buerger's disease, which is an inflammatory thrombotic disorder that affects small and medium vessels. The visual acuity (VA) of OD was 0.9, and in the funduscopy a very congestive papilla was observed, along with venous tortuosity, scattered retinal haemorrhages, but without macular oedema. He progressed favourably, with a complete recovery of VA. DISCUSSION: Papillophlebitis may be an ocular complication of Buerger's disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Buerger disease is a rare inflammatory vasculopathy presenting with severe claudication or critical limb ischemia. In this study, we sought to evaluate the feasibility and clinical outcomes of endovascular therapy for Buerger disease involving arteries in the lower extremities. METHODS: Between January 2006 and May 2016, there were 44 Buerger disease patients (43 men; mean age, 40.4 +/- 9.6 years) with 50 target limbs treated by endovascular therapy at  the Severance Cardiovascular Hospital. Baseline characteristics as well as both immediate and late clinical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The  majority (86.4%) of patients presented with critical limb ischemia. A total of 88 target lesions in 50 limbs were treated with endovascular procedures. All limbs showed infrapopliteal artery occlusions, and multilevel diseases involving the iliac or femoropopliteal artery were found in 31 patients (62%). Technical success was achieved in 80% of subjects. We found that a lower serum level of C-reactive protein, specifically the log C-reactive protein value (odds ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.71; P = .030), was an independent predictor of technical failure. The median follow-up duration was 29 months. Major adverse limb event-free survival and reintervention- and amputation-free survival were 83.3% and 67.9% at 3 years, respectively. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, previous endovascular treatment (hazard ratio, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.20-11.31; P = .022) and previous amputation (hazard ratio, 4.68;  95% CI, 1.37-15.96; P = .014) were identified as independent risk factors for reintervention- and amputation-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Buerger disease, endovascular treatment achieved technical success in the majority of the cases and was associated with favorable immediate and late clinical outcomes. These findings indicate that endovascular therapy may be considered a first-line treatment option for severe symptomatic patients with Buerger disease.

AB  - We evaluated the endothelial function of patients with Buerger disease using peripheral arterial tonometry test, and examined the factors that are significantly correlated with the endothelial dysfunction in these patients. We performed the peripheral arterial tonometry test in 22 patients with Buerger disease. We recorded the patients' characteristics, including ankle brachial pressure index and reactive hyperemia index, which reflect the endothelial dysfunction. We divided the patients with Buerger disease into the conservative treatment and lumbar sympathectomy group. While the reactive hyperemia index was  not significantly different between these two groups, the ankle brachial pressure index was significantly different (1.12 versus 0.83, P=0.003). Furthermore, the reactive hyperemia index was significantly correlated with the ankle brachial pressure index value in the patients in the lumbar sympathectomy group (rho=0.848, P=0.005). Given that patients with Buerger disease show impairment of the sympathetic nervous system, we should consider the after-effects of such an impaired system on the condition of these patients. The patients treated with lumbar sympathectomy might be more appropriate to evaluate their endothelial function by a peripheral arterial tonometry test.

AB  - Buerger disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a progressive, nonatherosclerotic, segmental, inflammatory disease that most often affects small and medium arteries of the upper and lower extremities. Initially described by von Winiwarter in 1879, although the eponym was given to Leo Buerger who published extensive pathologic findings from the amputated limbs of afflicted patients in 1908. The typical age range for occurrence is 20 to 50 years, and the disorder is more frequently found in men who smoke. Migratory superficial phlebitis can be present in up to 16% of patients and indicates a systemic inflammatory response.[1][2][3][4] Patients initially present with the foot, leg, arm, or hand claudication which may be mistaken for joint or neuromuscular problems. Progression of the disease leads to calf claudication, and eventually,  ischemic rest pain and ulcerations on the toes, feet, or fingers. This is also called Raynaud phenomenon. The treatment of TAO revolves around strict smoking cessation. In patients who can abstain, disease remission is impressive, and amputation avoidance is increased. The role of surgical intervention is minimal in Buerger disease as there is often no acceptable target vessel for bypass. Furthermore, autogenous vein conduits are limited secondary to coexisting migratory thrombophlebitis.[5][6][7]

AB  - RATIONALE: Slowly progressive hand ischemia is mostly associated with medical illness such as vasculitis, and in patients with smoking history, Buerger disease is often considered first. However, despite the very low incidence of vascular anatomical anomalies, they can lead to hand ischemia. And if there is no consideration for them, proper treatment cannot be selected. PATIENT CONCERNS: A  42-year-old male smoker presented with a slowly progressing 5th fingertip necrosis following blunt trauma. DIAGNOSES: Angiography revealed congenital hypoplasia of ulnar artery, and excluded Buerger disease or hypothenar hammer syndrome. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: We reconstructed the necrotic fingertip using a 2nd toe pulp free flap to reflect the patient's need. LESSONS: In this case report, the authors emphasize that the possibility of anatomical anomaly should be considered as a cause of the ischemia. Vascular imaging should be undertaken to investigate the cause of ischemia of the hand.

TI  - Buerger Test for Erythromelalgia Revisited.
PG  - 124-126
LID - 10.7556/jaoa.2017.023 [doi]
AB  - Leo Buerger, MD, was the first to describe dependent rubor associated with marked atherosclerosis. Historically, dependent rubor has been described as erythromelalgia (or erythromelia), and terms such as chronic rubor, reactionary rubor, induced rubor, and hyperemic response have also been used to describe this sign associated with peripheral vascular disease. This brief review will reacquaint physicians with the Buerger test, which is used to assess arterial sufficiency, as well as erythromelalgia, and the proposed mechanisms responsible  for erythromelalgia. The Buerger test is an important consideration when examining patients for erythromelalgia, which remains distinct from erythema associated with skin and soft-tissue infections.

TI  - Effect of Folic Acid therapy on Homocysteine Level in patients with Atherosclerosis or Buerger's Disease and in Healthy individuals: A clinical trial.
PG  - 3138-3143
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered a risk factor for atherosclerosis  and some other vascular diseases such as Buerger's disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the Homocysteine levels in 3 different groups of participants (Buerger's disease, atherosclerosis patients, and healthy cases) and determine the therapeutic effect of folic acid therapy on homocysteine levels for these three groups. METHODS: This nonrandomized clinical trial study was conducted in the vascular and endovascular surgery research center of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Mashhad, Iran. This interventional study consisted of 44 participants of which 22 patients had Buerger's disease and a control group of 22 healthy individuals, all of which were enrolled in this study. All of the study's participants had their serum homocysteine levels measured both before and after 12 weeks of folic acid (5mg/day) therapy. The data analysis used fo data analysis was a Chi square and t-test or their non-parametrical equivalents for data analysis by means of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. RESULTS: The homocysteine levels were  found to be significantly higher in patients with Buerger's disease as compared to other groups before treatment with folic acid (Buerger = 21.8 +/- 8.5 Mm/L, atherosclerosis = 17.3 +/- 6.9, healthy = 13.8 +/- 3.1; p < 0.001). After treatment with folic acid at 5 mg/daily for 12 weeks, the new plasma homocysteine levels did not show any significant difference (p = 0.38) between the Buerger's disease group (14.6 +/- 4.5 Mm/L) and atherosclerosis group (13.9 +/- 4.7), but it was found to besignificantly higher in both groups when compared to the healthy group (10.7 +/- 3.9, p<0.05). The plasma homocysteine level was reduced significantly when compared to its initial level in all 3 groups. The comparison  of differences among three groups was found not to be significant (p=0.41). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that supplementary therapy with folic acid at a dose of 5 mg daily may reduce the serum homocysteine levels significantly and may have a role in the development of vascular diseases such as Buerger's disease. We suggest that folic acid should be considered as a routine agent in the Buerger's  disease therapeutic regime. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th) with the ID: TCTR20160601003. FUNDING: This study was not funded by any organization.

TI  - Efficacy of bosentan in patients with refractory thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease): A case series and review of the literature.
PG  - e5511
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000005511 [doi]
AB  - The cornerstone of therapy in thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is complete abstinence from tobacco. In addition to discontinuation of cigarette smoking, very few pharmacological and surgical options of controversial efficacy are available to date. New therapeutic options with greater efficacy are clearly needed to properly manage these patients.In this preliminary study, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of bosentan in a case series of 8 adults with TAO and severe ischemic ulceronecrotic lesions who were treated with bosentan after inadequate response to platelet inhibitors, vasodilators, and intravenous alprostadil. Additionally, we reviewed 18 well-documented patients with refractory TAO treated with bosentan, which was previously reported (PubMed 1965-2015). These 26 patients formed the basis of our present analysis. All were  current smokers.The median duration of bosentan treatment (SD) was 4.5 +/- 4 months (range 3-16). Eleven patients (42%) were unable to completely abstain from smoking during their follow-up. With bosentan treatment, no new ischemic lesions  were observed in the target extremities. A complete therapeutic response was achieved in 80% of patients, whereas a partial response was observed in 12%. Two  patients (8%) ultimately required amputation despite treatment.After discontinuation of bosentan, patients were followed for a median of 20 +/- 14 months (range 3-60). Two patients whose trophic lesions had healed relapsed.When  comparing patients who gave up smoking with those who were unable to completely abstain from smoking during follow-up, no significant differences were found in efficacy outcomes. Four patients (15%) developed adverse events, requiring bosentan discontinuation in 1 case.These preliminary data suggest that bosentan may be considered a therapeutic option for treatment of cases of severe TAO refractory to conventional treatment, and merit further evaluation in larger controlled, randomized clinical studies.

TI  - A quantitative real-time assessment of Buerger exercise on dorsal foot peripheral skin circulation in patients with diabetes foot.
PG  - e5334
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000005334 [doi]
AB  - Buerger exercise can improve the peripheral circulation of lower extremities. However, the evidence and a quantitative assessment of skin perfusion immediately after this exercise in patients with diabetes feet are still rare.We recruited 30 patients with unilateral or bilateral diabetic ulcerated feet in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chia-Yi Branch, from October 2012 to December 2013. Real-time  dorsal foot skin perfusion pressures (SPPs) before and after Buerger exercise were measured and analyzed. In addition, the severity of ischemia and the presence of ulcers before exercise were also stratified.A total of 30 patients with a mean age of 63.4 +/- 13.7 years old were enrolled in this study. Their mean duration of diabetes was 13.6 +/- 8.2 years. Among them, 26 patients had unilateral and 4 patients had bilateral diabetes foot ulcers. Of the 34 wounded feet, 23 (68%) and 9 (27%) feet were classified as Wagner class II and III, respectively. The real-time SPP measurement indicated that Buerger exercise significantly increased the level of SPP by more than 10 mm Hg (n = 46, 58.3 vs 70.0 mm Hg, P < 0.001). In terms of pre-exercise dorsal foot circulation condition, the results showed that Buerger exercise increased the level of SPP in severe ischemia (n = 5, 22.1 vs 37.3 mm Hg, P = 0.043), moderate ischemia (n = 14, 42.2 vs 64.4 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and borderline-normal (n = 7, 52.9 vs 65.4 mm Hg, P = 0.028) groups, respectively. However, the 20 feet with SPP levels more than 60 mm Hg were not improved significantly after exercise (n = 20, 58.3 vs 71.5 mm Hg, P = 0.239). As to the presence of ulcers, Buerger exercise increased  the level of SPP in either unwounded feet (n = 12, 58.5 vs 66.0 mm Hg, P = 0.012) or wounded feet (n = 34, 58.3 vs 71.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001). The majority of the ulcers was either completely healed (9/34 = 27%) or still improving (14/34 = 41%).This study quantitatively demonstrates the evidence of dorsal foot peripheral circulation improvement after Buerger exercise in patients with diabetes.

TI  - Vascular Function and Intima-media Thickness of a Leg Artery in Peripheral Artery Disease: A Comparison of Buerger Disease and Atherosclerotic Peripheral Artery Disease.
PG  - 1261-1269
AB  - AIM: Both vascular function and structure are independent predictors of cardiovascular events. The purpose of this study was to evaluate vascular function and structure of a leg artery in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). METHODS: We measured flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and nitroglycerine-induced vasodilation (NID) as indices of vascular function and intima-media thickness (IMT) as an index of vascular structure of the popliteal artery in 100 subjects, including 20 patients with Buerger disease and 30 patients with atherosclerotic PAD, 20 age- and sex-matched subjects without Buerger disease (control group) and 30 age- and sex-matched patients without atherosclerotic PAD (control group). RESULTS: IMT was significantly larger in the Buerger group than in the control group (Buerger, 0.63+/- 0.20 mm; control, 0.50+/-0.07 mm; P=0.01), whereas there were no significant differences in FMD and NID between the two groups. IMT was significantly larger in the atherosclerotic PAD group than in the control group (atherosclerotic PAD, 0.80+/-0.22 mm; control, 0.65+/-0.14 mm; P0.01), and FMD and NID were significantly smaller in the atherosclerotic PAD group than in the control group (FMD: atherosclerotic PAD, 3.9%+/-1.1%; control, 5.0%+/-1.8%; P0.01; and NID: atherosclerotic PAD, 6.1%+/-2.0%; control, 8.4%+/-2.1%; P0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that vascular function is preserved in patients with Buerger disease and that both vascular function and vascular structure are impaired in patients with atherosclerotic PAD.

TI  - Buerger's disease: providing integrated care.
PG  - 511-518
AB  - Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), is a segmental inflammatory disease affecting small- and medium-sized vessels, which is strongly associated with tobacco use. Although the etiology is still unknown, recent studies suggest an immunopathogenesis. Diagnosis is based on clinical and angiomorphologic criteria, including age, history of smoking, clinical presentation with distal extremity ischemia, and the absence of other risk factors for atherosclerosis, autoimmune disease, hypercoagulable states, or embolic disease. Until now, no causative therapy exists for TAO. The most important therapeutic intervention is smoking cessations and intravenous prostanoid infusions (iloprost). Furthermore, effective analgesia is crucial for  the treatment of ischemic and neuropathic pain and might be expanded by spinal cord stimulation. Revascularization procedures do not play a major role in the treatment of TAO due to the distal localization of arterial occlusion. More recently, immunoadsorption has been introduced eliminating vasoconstrictive G-protein-coupled receptor and other autoantibodies. Cell-based therapies and treatment with bosentan were also advocated. Finally, a consequent prevention and treatment of wounds and infections are essential for the prevention of amputations. To achieve better clinical results, integrated care in multidisciplinary and trans-sectoral teams with emphasis on smoking cessation, pain control, wound management, and social care by professionals, social workers, and family members is necessary.

LID - 10.1055/s-0035-1571190 [doi]
AB  - During a review of patients admitted with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), there was evidence of normochromic normocytic anemia and abrupt changes in hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in patients with several hospital admissions. Therefore, the evidence of hemolytic anemia was evaluated based on 37 banked plasma samples taken from Caucasian male TAO patients during disease exacerbation between 2012 and 2014. The patients' hospital records, including clinical manifestations and complete blood count, were evaluated. The following tests were performed on all samples: indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, indirect  bilirubin, d-aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and d-alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The mean age of the patients was 40 +/- 7 years. Two patients underwent below-knee amputation. The mean hospital-documented Hgb of the patients was 12.9  +/- 2.6 g/dL. CRP and IAT were positive in 75.6 and 70.2% of the samples, respectively. The tests and corresponding results were as follows: hsCRP, 14.07 +/- 2.37 microg/mL; LDH, 2,552 +/- 315 u/L; haptoglobin, 2.27 +/- 1.1 g/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.09 +/- 0.04 mg/dL; AST, 67 +/- 7 u/L; and ALT, 26 +/- 3 u/L. There was a significant inverse correlation between hsCRP and hospital-documented Hgb level (p = 0.03). Anemia with the positive IAT in most of the samples, high LDH and AST, and normal ALT are suggestive of hemolytic anemia. Normal indirect bilirubin is consistent with intravascular hemolysis. The positive CRP and elevated haptoglobin levels could be due to systemic inflammation in TAO. However, it is not known if an autoantigen or an infectious  antigen is responsible for TAO systemic inflammation and induction hemolytic anemia. As such, the underlying mechanism of anemia in TAO could be part of the footprint of its main etiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently there is no data on peripheral arterial disease prevalence  in Russia. AIM: To estimate prevalence of patients with symptomatic low limb ischemia (LLI) in Russian Federation on 2014. PATIENTS AND METHODS: <<League for  patient' protection>> had sent questionnaires for all regional health departments asking to name prevalence of ICD-10 codes I70.2 (atherosclerosis of arteries of extremities) and I73.1 (thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger)) on 2014. The figures were listed separately for ischemia I-IIa and III-IV (critical limb ischemia, CLI) (Pokrovsky, 1976). Also were mentioned major amputations and mortality. RESULTS: Total number of received questionnaires was 44, we've got information from all RF' federal regions with a population of appr. 71 million people. There were 174 125 cases of symptomatic LLI. Prevalence of symptomatic LLI among Russian population aged more than 40 years was 0.51%. Prevalence of intermittent claudication was 0.36% and of critical limb ischemia - 0.13%. Rate of major amputations was 6.9%. CONCLUSION: World PAD prevalence among people older than 25 years is 8.3%. The same figure in our study was only 0.5%. This is  due to the fact that we considered only symptomatic LLI and only with codes I70.2 and I73.1. Prevalence of symptomatic patients among all PAD patients is 10-35%. So the real number of PAD patients in Russian might be 1.5-5%. We can conclude that PAD is still unrevealed in Russia. Another conclusion could be that the treatment results are less than satisfactory. Finally there is urgent necessity for special PAD register in RF.

TI  - Corkscrew Collateral Vessels in Buerger Disease: Vasa Vasorum or Vasa Nervorum.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the origin of "corkscrew" collateral vessels around the occluded popliteal artery in patients with Buerger disease by Doppler ultrasound  (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in tandem with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2015, 42  patients diagnosed with Buerger disease were identified retrospectively. Patients in whom occlusion of the popliteal artery was found on DSA of the lower extremity were subjected to Doppler US and MR imaging prospectively. Fifteen of 42 patients were identified as having the required characteristics, of whom 10 participated in the present study. RESULTS: Ten patients with occlusion of the popliteal artery were selected for inclusion, and 12 lower limbs of these patients were investigated. The study cohort comprised one woman and nine men with a mean age of 41 years +/- 10 (standard deviation; range, 39-58 y). Corkscrew collateral vessels identified on DSA examinations were also identified on secondary imaging  (Doppler US and MR imaging) in all patients except one in whom the popliteal artery was reconstituted after short-segment occlusion. The origin of the corkscrew collateral vessels was identified as the vasa nervorum of the tibial nerve in nine patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the present study suggest that corkscrew collateral vessels at the knee level in patients with Buerger disease originate from the vasa nervorum of the tibial nerve rather than the vasa vasorum of the popliteal artery if the latter is occluded.

PG  - 9-11
LID - 10.1016/j.radcr.2015.06.003 [doi]
AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) is an occlusive, nonatherosclerotic, inflammatory vasculitis that causes ischemia in small and medium vessels. Most commonly, Buerger disease is diagnosed in 40- to 45-year-old men with a heavy smoking history. Our case exemplifies the most common presentation, diagnosis, and treatment in a 53-year-old male smoker who presents with arm pain and dusky cool fingers. A Buerger diagnosis requires exclusion of autoimmune, diabetic, and embolic causes. The only recognized treatment for this disease is smoking cessation.

LID - 10.1107/S2052520615018156 [doi]
AB  - We report on high-pressure angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction data up to 15 GPa and ab initio total-energy calculations up to 242 GPa for KBrO3. No phase transition was found below 15 Pa in contrast to previously reported data. Its experimental bulk modulus in the quasi-hydrostatic regime is B0 = 18.8 (9) GPa with a bulk modulus pressure derivative B'0 = 8.2 (4). However, according to our  ab initio calculations, KBrO3 significantly reduces its rhombohedral distortion via small cooperative movements of the atoms and the structure progressively approaches the cubic symmetry, where the KBr subarray would adopt a topology similar to that of the corresponding B2-type bromide. This rearrangement of atoms is directly related to the Buerger's mechanism of the B1-B2 phase transition for  halides, confirming that cations (second neighbors) do not arrange in an arbitrary way. The O atoms forming the [BrO3] pyramidal units move smoothly with  pressure to the center of the [K8] cube faces, where electron localization function calculations present their maxima in other B2-type compounds, eventually adopting the perovskite-type structure at P approximately 152 GPa. Our data on KBrO3 has been compared with chemically substituted isostructural halates, providing new insights on the compressibility of this family of compounds.

PG  - 632-8
LID - 10.1536/ihj.15-191 [doi]
AB  - Buerger disease is a rare disease of unknown etiology and cannot be treated by bypass surgery or percutaneous re-endovascularization. Although the need for effective limb ischemia prevention strategies is increasingly being recognized, effective preventative strategies are insufficient. The aim of this study using a new pulsed ultrasound device, SX-1001, is to determine whether treatment using SX-1001 can mitigate rest pain and improve blood supply to ischemic legs in patients with Buerger disease. This study is a multicenter, double-blinded, parallel randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy and safety of SX-1001. Treatment using SX-1001 is expected to result in reduction of the visual analog scale score for pain in Buerger disease patients who have Fontaine stage III. A total of 44 patients from 20 hospitals in Japan will be enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is a change in rest pain intensity on the visual analog scale score from baseline to 24 weeks. This trial will be the first to show the safety and efficacy of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound using SX-1001 for clinical symptoms in patients with Buerger disease. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound may be a new therapy for limb ischemia. Ethical approval has been obtained from each of  the participating institutes. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences.This study is registered at  UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (UMIN000014757).

LID - 10.1063/1.4928645 [doi]
AB  - We employ Hartree-Fock, second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation, coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) as well as CCSD plus perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) theory to study the pressure induced transition from the rocksalt to the cesium chloride crystal structure in LiH. We show that the calculated transition pressure converges rapidly in this series of increasingly accurate many-electron  wave function based theories. Using CCSD(T) theory, we predict a transition pressure for the structural phase transition in the LiH crystal of 340 GPa. Furthermore, we investigate the potential energy surface for this transition in the parameter space of the Buerger path.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Buerger disease is a nonatherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease,  which is mostly observed in young male smokers. Buerger disease is characterized  by the observation of peripheral arterial occlusion by angiography. The condition may be caused by microembolization in the small-sized arteries of the distal extremities. Buerger disease is diagnosed based on the Shionoya's clinical diagnostic criteria, which include: (1) a history of smoking, (2) onset before the age of 50 years, (3) the presence of infrapopliteal arterial occlusions, (4)  either upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, and (5) the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors other than smoking. Several studies have reported that oral bacterial infections (periodontitis) could activate the onset of Buerger disease. In this study, we report the epidemiologic and clinical manifestations of patients with Buerger disease. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients who were surgically treated between July 1989 and June 2014 at Tokyo Medical and  Dental University Hospital were enrolled in this study. All of the patients clinically diagnosed with Buerger disease based on Shionoya's clinical diagnostic criteria. Fifty-five male and 3 female patients were treated. The mean age of the patients was 48 years (range, 21-73 years). RESULTS: All of the patients were either smokers or had a history of smoking. The mean Brinkman index score was 780 (range, 150-1,640). Their mean age at the onset of Buerger disease was 38 years (range, 21-50). The arterial lesions extended to the femoral arteries in 25% of cases, to the iliac arteries in 8% and to the abdominal aorta and/or visceral arteries in 6% of cases. Upper limb involvement, including cyanosis, paleness, and gangrene, was obvious in 84% of patients, and phlebitis migrans was recognized in 34%. The lower extremities symptoms involved intermittent claudication in 23% of the patients, rest pain in 13% of the patients, and ulceration or gangrene in 64% of the patients. Fifteen patients had undergone surgical arterial reconstruction, 4 patients had received endovascular therapy, 33 patients had undergone lumbar sympathectomy and 8 patients had undergone thoracic sympathectomy. Twenty percent of the patients needed minor limb amputations, and 4% required major limb amputations. In the patients who were examined for their oral conditions, periodontitis corresponding to grades B (moderate periodontitis), C (severe periodontitis), and D (edentulous patients) was revealed in 31%, 56%, and 13% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the Buerger disease patients in this study were suffering from  severe periodontitis. It is possible that not only the cessation of smoking, but  also the improvement of periodontal care could improve the clinical symptoms related to Buerger disease.

TI  - Ocular Inflammation in the Setting of Concomitant Systemic Autoimmune Conditions  in an Older Male Population.
PG  - 762-7
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000000437 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the frequency and types of inflammatory ocular manifestations of specific systemic autoimmune diseases in a South Florida Veterans Affairs Hospital population. METHODS: Demographic and medical diagnosis information was extracted from the Veterans Administration database for 1225 patients. These patients were seen in Miami and Broward Veterans Affairs hospitals between April 18, 2008, and April 17, 2013, and were diagnosed with at least 1 of the following: systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoid, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Kawasaki disease, polyarteritis nodosa, Buerger  disease, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Behcet syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, other polyarteritis nodosa-associated vasculitides, or arteritis not otherwise specified. RESULTS: Of 1225 patients, 618 were seen in the VA eye clinic and 25 were diagnosed with concomitant inflammatory ocular conditions. Uveitis was the most common, and included 8 cases of anterior, 1 anterior-intermediate, 1 intermediate, 2 panuveitis, and 3 unspecified. Other manifestations included 7 cases of keratitis and 2 each of scleritis, episcleritis, and acute ischemic optic neuropathy. The overall frequency of inflammatory ocular disease was 2%. The diseases associated with the highest frequency of ocular involvement were granulomatosis with polyangiitis (1/8), sarcoid (9/198), giant cell arteritis (2/68), and rheumatoid arthritis (11/576).  Of these 25 patients, 9 were diagnosed with eye disease before systemic disease.  CONCLUSIONS: In this population, ocular manifestations were rarely the presenting feature of systemic disease, but autoimmune disorders are an important underlying cause of inflammatory eye disease that should be considered on first evaluation,  even in this "nontraditional," predominantly male, autoimmune disease population.

TI  - Effects of Buerger Exercise Combined Health-Promoting Program on Peripheral Neurovasculopathy Among Community Residents at High Risk for Diabetic Foot Ulceration.
PG  - 145-53
LID - 10.1111/wvn.12091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy and vasculopathy are important risk factors for diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). Buerger exercises for patients with arterial occlusive disease have previously been noted; however, current evidence to support this intervention is limited. AIM: We established a standardized procedure for Buerger exercises combined with a health-promoting program and investigated its effectiveness in reducing peripheral neurovasculopathy among rural Taiwanese residents with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of developing DFU. METHODS: A one group quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used. The Buerger exercise protocol composed of a three-step posture change with 9 minutes for each cycle. The health-promoting program composed of six dimensions of healthy habits. Outcome measurements 1 year after the beginning of  the intervention included the ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), the Michigan neuropathy screening instrument (MNSI), blood pressure, frequency of self-reported leg discomfort, and a type 2 Diabetes Health Promoting Score. FINDINGS: Thirty-one of 66 (47%) subjects completed this study. Buerger exercises combined with the health-promoting program significantly improved (a) the ABI in  the legs, (b) health-promoting behaviors, (c) MNSI values, and (d) leg discomfort symptoms. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This study supports the use of Buerger exercises combined with the health-promoting program to improve symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral circulation in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Symmetry of semi-reduced lattices.
PG  - 268-78
LID - 10.1107/S2053273315001096 [doi]
AB  - The main result of this work is extension of the famous characterization of Bravais lattices according to their metrical, algebraic and geometric properties  onto a wide class of primitive lattices (including Buerger-reduced, nearly Buerger-reduced and a substantial part of Delaunay-reduced) related to low-restricted semi-reduced descriptions (s.r.d.'s). While the `geometric' operations in Bravais lattices map the basis vectors into themselves, the `arithmetic' operators in s.r.d. transform the basis vectors into cell vectors (basis vectors, face or space diagonals) and are represented by matrices from the set {\bb V} of all 960 matrices with the determinant +/-1 and elements {0, +/-1}  of the matrix powers. A lattice is in s.r.d. if the moduli of off-diagonal elements in both the metric tensors M and M(-1) are smaller than corresponding diagonal elements sharing the same column or row. Such lattices are split into 379 s.r.d. types relative to the arithmetic holohedries. Metrical criteria for each type do not need to be explicitly given but may be modelled as linear derivatives {\bb M}(p,q,r), where {\bb M} denotes the set of 39 highest-symmetry  metric tensors, and p,q,r describe changes of appropriate interplanar distances.  A sole filtering of {\bb V} according to an experimental s.r.d. metric and subsequent geometric interpretation of the filtered matrices lead to mathematically stable and rich information on the Bravais-lattice symmetry and deviations from the exact symmetry. The emphasis on the crystallographic features of lattices was obtained by shifting the focus (i) from analysis of a lattice metric to analysis of symmetry matrices [Himes & Mighell (1987). Acta Cryst. A43, 375-384], (ii) from the isometric approach and invariant subspaces to the orthogonality concept {some ideas in Le Page [J. Appl. Cryst. (1982), 15, 255-259]} and splitting indices [Stroz (2011). Acta Cryst. A67, 421-429] and (iii) from fixed cell transformations to transformations derivable via geometric  information (Himes & Mighell, 1987; Le Page, 1982). It is illustrated that corresponding arithmetic and geometric holohedries share space distribution of symmetry elements. Moreover, completeness of the s.r.d. types reveals their combinatorial structure and simplifies the crystallographic description of structural phase transitions, especially those observed with the use of powder diffraction. The research proves that there are excellent theoretical and practical reasons for looking at crystal lattice symmetry from an entirely new and surprising point of view - the combinatorial set {\bb V} of matrices, their semi-reduced lattice context and their geometric properties.

AB  - We present a man with refractory leg ulcers, bilateral varicosis of the lower extremities, and Buerger disease. Autoimmune work-up was negative. However, chromosome analysis showed Klinefelter syndrome (48 XXY). Ulcerative lesions of the lower extremities are a complication of Klinefelter syndrome. To date, the pathogenesis of ulcers in Klinefelter syndrome has not been clarified, but several factors, such as abnormalities of fibrinolysis and prothrombotic states,  might be involved. Our present case emphasizes the importance of considering Klinefelter syndrome in the differential diagnosis of a male patient with nonhealing ulcers of the lower extremities.

AB  - Buerger disease is a nonatherosclerotic vasculitis that is triggered by substantial exposure to tobacco. This disease usually affects small- and medium-sized arteries in the upper and lower extremities. All clinicians who take care of patients with peripheral arterial disease should know the clinical features and diagnostic evaluation of Buerger disease. In this article, we review the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for Buerger disease. We describe the diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of having Buerger disease and discuss the typical findings on noninvasive arterial studies and angiography. Lastly, we review the management of these patients, including medical therapy, with an emphasis on smoking cessation, as well as the potential role of revascularization, both surgical and endovascular.

AB  - Hand ischemia caused by vasculitis is a secondary finding in many autoimmune processes. Many of these autoimmune diseases are managed primarily with medications that can prevent the development of occlusive disease, tissue ischemia, and tissue loss. Unfortunately several disease conditions can be recalcitrant to medical management and can result in ischemic changes within the  hand, which may require operative intervention. This article briefly reviews the  major connective tissue disorders associated with vasculitis and vaso-occlusive disease of the hand, including scleroderma, lupus, and Buerger disease, and their surgical treatment.

TI  - The infrapopliteal arterial occlusions similar to buerger disease: report of two  cases.
PG  - 874528
LID - 10.1155/2014/874528 [doi]
AB  - We herein present two cases that required the differential diagnosis of Buerger disease. Case 1 involved a 55-year-old male with a smoking habit who was admitted with ulcers and coldness in his fingers and toes. Angiography showed blockage in  both the radial and posterior tibial arteries, which led to an initial diagnosis  of Buerger disease. However, a biopsy of the right posterior tibial artery showed pathological findings of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Case 2 involved a 28-year-old male with intermittent claudication who was examined at another hospital. Angiography showed occlusion of both popliteal and crural arteries, and the patient was suspected to have Buerger disease. However, computed tomography disclosed an abnormal slip on both sides of the popliteal fossa, and we diagnosed him with bilateral popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). These cases illustrate that other occlusive diseases, such as FMD and PAES, may sometimes be  misdiagnosed as Buerger disease.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO, Buerger's disease) is an inflammatory vascular disease affecting small and medium sized arteries and veins. It is characterized  by segmental thrombotic occlusions by highly mononuclear cellular thrombi. Its occurrence and re-occurrence is closely related to tobacco use. Immunohistological examinations and the detections of various autoantibodies led  to the new paradigm of an immunopathogenesis of TAO. Clinically it is characterized by distal ischemia syndromes in young people and high amputation rates. This article summarizes the disease characteristics, clinical features, and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and focuses on new therapeutic options, i.e. stem cell derived therapies, immunoadsorption, and the endothelin-receptor-blocking agent bosentan.

TI  - Noninvasive Transcutaneous Monitoring in Long-Term Follow-Up of Patients With Thromboangiitis Obliterans Treated With Intravenous Iloprost.
PG  - 531-8
LID - 10.1177/0003319714541800 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated the effectiveness of intravenous iloprost (IVI) in outpatients with  thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) and lower limb noninvasive transcutaneous monitoring (TCM) at follow-up (FU). Ten consecutive patients with TAO underwent IVI therapy. Transcutaneous oxygen (TcPo 2) and carbon dioxide (TcPco 2) determination and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) were performed before and after IVI at 3, 6, and 12 months of FU. Clinical response was positive in 7 patients, whereas 3 nonresponders underwent a second IVI cycle with 1 showing a late positive clinical response. After 12 months of FU, all patients were alive without amputations. Supine and dependent TcP2 levels significantly improved (P < .005). Hallux LDF values showed significant change with the maximal hyperemic test at 44 degrees C (P < .005). Forefoot maximal hyperemic test at 44 degrees C  LDF (P < .005) and improved venous arterial reflex (P < .05) showed statistically significant time evolution. We demonstrated some degree of IVI effectiveness and  evaluated TCM in patients with TAO.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Thromboangiitis obliterans is a common peripheral vascular disease in India. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of thoracoscopic dorsal sympathectomy as a treatment for Buerger disease of the upper extremities. METHODS: Thirty thoracoscopic dorsal sympathectomies (17 left- and 13 right-sided) were performed in a tertiary medical center in 5 women and 20 men (mean age, 41 years) between July 2010 and February 2013. RESULTS: The mean operative time was 30 minutes, and the mean hospital stay was 52 hours. There were no complications. All patients had improvement in pain and were relapse-free after a mean follow-up period of 11.63 months. DISCUSSION: Thoracoscopic dorsal sympathectomy reduces pain significantly by reducing peripheral resistance and promoting collateral development. The increased magnification of the thoracoscopic approach permits better visualization, ensuring complete excision and therefore good results. Thoracoscopic dorsal sympathectomy for Buerger disease of the upper limb is a safe and effective treatment.

TI  - Cannabis use: signal of increasing risk of serious cardiovascular disorders.
PG  - e000638
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.113.000638 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis is known to be associated with neuropsychiatric problems, but less is known about complications affecting other specified body systems. We  report and analyze 35 recent remarkable cardiovascular complications following cannabis use. METHODS AND RESULTS: In France, serious cases of abuse and dependence in response to the use of psychoactive substances must be reported to  the national system of the French Addictovigilance Network. We identified all spontaneous reports of cardiovascular complications related to cannabis use collected by the French Addictovigilance Network from 2006 to 2010. We described  the clinical characteristics of these cases and their evolution: 1.8% of all cannabis-related reports (35/1979) were cardiovascular complications, with patients being mostly men (85.7%) and of an average age of 34.3 years. There were 22 cardiac complications (20 acute coronary syndromes), 10 peripheral complications (lower limb or juvenile arteriopathies and Buerger-like diseases),  and 3 cerebral complications (acute cerebral angiopathy, transient cortical blindness, and spasm of cerebral artery). In 9 cases, the event led to patient death. CONCLUSIONS: Increased reporting of cardiovascular complications related to cannabis and their extreme seriousness (with a death rate of 25.6%) indicate cannabis as a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease in young adults, in line with previous findings. Given that cannabis is perceived to be harmless by the general public and that legalization of its use is debated, data concerning its danger must be widely disseminated. Practitioners should be aware that cannabis may be a potential triggering factor for cardiovascular complications in young people.

TI  - Smoking and Thromboangitis Obliterans- Are they related ?
PG  - 802-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In 1908 Leo Buerger first gave the world the clinical picture of this dreadful disease which he called Thromboangitis Obliterans. Virtually all investigators believe that smoking or tobacco use in some form is a requirement for the diagnosis of Thromboangitis Obliterans. We studied the demographic profile and smoking pattern of patients with Thromboangiitis Obliterans. METHODS: Retrospective study carried out in a tertiary level hospital of South India from  1st January 1997 to 31st December 2003. Patients fulfilling Shionoya's criteria form the study group. Incidence of Thromboangitis Obliterans, relation to smoking habits, type and nature of manifestation were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 105 cases were studied and found to have declining pattern of incidence from 0.9%-0.3%. All patients were males, smokers at the time admission and 76% out of  them were from low socioeconomic background. Patients smoking 5-15 cigarettes per day, for 5-10 years duration constituted 45% of the study group. The most frequent reasons for being referred to hospital were ischemic ulcers (83.80%), claudication (78.0%) and rest pain (26.66%). CONCLUSIONS: In those who present early with the disease the number of cigarettes and duration of smoking shows no  direct correlation to the severity. Most patients continue to smoke inspite of counseling and awareness that the disease progresses due to smoking. Ulcer, intermittent claudication and rest pain are the three common presenting symptoms  of Thromboangitis Obliterans.

AB  - A 58-year-old male patient had diagnosed with Buerger's disease for 30 years. Patient referred us with non-healing scar on his right thumb. In another center,  amputation was suggested due to his non-healing scar. We have assessed the patient multidisciplinary with cardiovascular and plastic reconstructive esthetic surgery for non-healing scar. During the multidisciplinary surgical treatment we  applied radial artery endarterectomy, cross finger flap reconstruction, after operation medically we have treated with cilostazol. Patient's scar completely healed. Follow up one year patient have no problem and radial artery in angiography was opened.

PG  - 114-7
LID - 10.1177/0003319713516379 [doi]
AB  - We assessed the effectiveness of iloprost treatment in the management of symptomatic Buerger disease (BD) and assessed smoking cessation compliance, based on a single-center experience. Thirteen patients with BD were treated with sessions of intravenous (IV) Ilomedin infusion. At 1-year follow-up, pain status  alteration, number of analgesics required, ankle-brachial index (ABI) change, compliance with supervised smoking cessation, and amputation-free rate were recorded. The pain status improved considerably according to a visual analog scale, the number of analgesics required was significantly reduced, and all patients improved their pain-free walking distance, the ABI, and their self-reported quality of life. Only 2 patients required minor amputations. Combination of IV Ilomedin infusion, supervised smoking cessation, and a specific follow-up protocol may lead to improvement in pain-free walking distance, pain status, quality of life, and substantial reduction in amputation risk.

AB  - The noninfectious, inflammatory vasculitides include giant cell arteritis, Takayasu disease, Churg-Strauss angiitis, Wegener disease, polyarteritis nodosa,  microscopic polyangiitis, Buerger disease, amyloid-beta-related angiitis, and isolated vasculitis of the central nervous system. While these disorders are relatively uncommon, they produce a variety of neurologic diseases including muscle disease, mononeuropathy multiplex, polyneuropathy, cranial nerve palsies,  visual loss, seizures, an encephalopathy, venous thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage. The multisystem vasculitides often have stereotypical clinical findings that reflect disease of the kidney, sinuses, lungs, skin, joints, or cardiovascular system. These disorders also usually have abnormalities found on serologic testing. Isolated vasculitis of the central nervous system is  more difficult to diagnose because the clinical and brain imaging findings are relatively nonspecific. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid will demonstrate changes consistent with an inflammatory process. Arteriography often shows areas  of segmental narrowing affecting multiple intracranial vessels and brain/meningeal biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis. Management of  patients with a multisystem vasculitis or isolated vasculitis of the central nervous system is centered on the administration of immunosuppressive agents. In  many cases, corticosteroids remain the mainstay of medical treatment.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger disease, is a nonatherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease of small and medium-sized arteries of the distal extremities occurring predominantly in young men who are long-term tobacco smokers. We treated 2 patients who presented with TAO involving popliteal and tibial arteries. Directional atherectomy with a SilverHawk device was used to recanalize the arteries without major complications. During follow-up conducted using computed tomography or sonography, we observed that the treated vessels remained patent. These cases report illustrate the feasibility and immediate effectiveness of endovascular SilverHawk directional atherectomy in TAO patients with occlusion of the popliteal arteries.

AB  - I expect that every reader of this Journal is only too familiar with seeing an elderly patient, male more commonly than female, who is admitted with a gangrenous leg. Younger subjects, in their twenties and thirties, are fortunately much less common; the majority of these are severe and poorly controlled diabetics. I very much doubt if any of you, unless you work in a specialised vascular unit, have seen in this age group an example of thromboangiitis obliterans, more commonly called Buerger's disease.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, is a chronic nonatherosclerotic endarteritis manifesting as inflammation and thrombosis of distal extremity small and medium-sized arteries resulting in relapsing episodes of distal extremity ischemia. Takayasu arteritis is a rare syndrome characterized by inflammation of  the aortic arch, pulmonary, coronary, and cerebral vessels, presenting with cerebrovascular symptoms, myocardial ischemia, or upper extremity claudication in young, often female, patients. Kawasaki disease is a small- and medium-vessel acute systemic vasculitis of young children, with morbidity and mortality stemming from coronary artery aneurysms. Microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss  syndrome, and Wegener granulomatosis are systemic small-vessel vasculitides, affecting arterioles, capillary beds and venules, and each presenting with variable effects on the pulmonary, renal and gastrointestinal systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells are useful in regenerative medicine for various diseases, but it remains unclear whether the aging of donors alters the multipotency of these cells. In this study, we examined age-related changes in the chondrogenic, osteogenic and adipogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells from 17 donors (25-81 years old), including patients with or without systemic vascular diseases. METHODS: All stem  cell lines were expanded with fibroblast growth factor-2 and then exposed to differentiation induction media. The chondrogenic potential was determined from the glycosaminoglycan content and the SOX9, collagen type 2 alpha 1 (COL2A1) and  aggrecan (AGG) messenger RNA levels. The osteogenic potential was determined by monitoring the alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content, and the adipogenic potential was determined from the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and oil red O staining. RESULTS: Systemic vascular diseases, including arteriosclerosis obliterans and Buerger disease, did not significantly affect the trilineage differentiation potential of the cells. Under these conditions, all chondrocyte markers examined, including the SOX9 messenger RNA level, showed age-related decline, whereas none of the osteoblast or adipocyte markers showed age-dependent changes. CONCLUSIONS: The aging of donors from young adult to elderly selectively decreased the chondrogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells. This information will be useful in stromal cell-based therapy for cartilage-related diseases.

TI  - Vasculitides as a rare cause of intermittent claudication.
PG  - 353-6
AB  - Intermittent claudication of the lower extremities is a common symptom described  in older patients with atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease due to atherosclerosis is known to be associated with a higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and all-cause mortality. However, if intermittent claudication appears in a younger group of patients or older patients in absence of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis such as smoking, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus other causes than atherosclerosis must be considered. These conditions include vasculitides, fibromuscular dysplasia, cystic adventitial disease, excentric vascular compression by tumor, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, trauma or dissection. Vasculitides present a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by inflammatory destruction of blood vessels. Although often not a leading symptom intermittent claudication could be a part of a clinical picture in giant-cell arteritis, Takayasu s arteritis, Buerger s disease, polyarteritis nodosa or Behcet disease. Limb claudication is usually of rapid onset, progressive and bilateral. Each of the mentioned vasculitides is specific in ethiology and clinical manifestation with a variable prognosis for the patient. Increased awareness of the presence of different causes of limb claudication and their early diagnosis with a prompt initiation of appropriate treatment may help to avoid clinical progression that can lead to vascular surgery or even limb loss (Ref. 37).

AB  - The patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction are primarily managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolysis. It is well accepted that rescue PCI should be implemented in case of unsuccessful thrombolysis. However, the reverse, rescue thrombolysis, that is, administering of thrombolytic therapy in a patient in whom primary PCI fails, is not well defined. There are no available data about rescue thrombolysis so far. We represent a 43-year-old male  patient with Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) who was admitted to our emergency department for cardiac shock related to inferior and right ventricular  ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He was found to have occlusion of both right  coronary artery and left anterior descending artery and managed with rescue thrombolysis. It was subsequently recognized that he had concurrent stroke caused by posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion and improved with thrombolysis. It is reported for the first time that rescue thrombolysis has been put into practice and yielded great result after unsuccessful primary PCI.

PG  - 93-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between homocysteine levels and Buerger's disease in a case-control study. METHODS: 25 patients with Buerger's disease based on Shionoya's clinical criteria, and 25 heavy smokers along with 25 healthy non-smokers (control) were recruited for this study. All groups were matched for age. Plasma homocysteine levels were measured in each patient and then compared between the three groups.  RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration of homocysteine was 16.88 mmol/L in the Buerger sufferers; as for the smoker (group 2) and control (group 3) groups, the  level was as low as 13.89 and 13.56 mmol/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with thromboangiitis obliterans, especially those with a progressive course, benefit from the hyperhomocysteinemia screening test.

TI  - Assessment of plasma prothrombotic factors in patients with Buerger's disease.
PG  - 133-9
LID - 10.1097/MBC.0b013e32835b7272 [doi]
AB  - The pathogenesis of Buerger' disease (thrombangiitis obliterans; TAO) remains unknown, although a strong association with tobacco use has been established. Blood coagulation and fibrinolytic factors as well as selected clinical chemistry parameters have been evaluated in 37 patients with Buerger's disease. Median levels of prothrombotic factors were higher in patients with TAO than in healthy  control: annexin V (P < 0.0003), factor VII (P < 0.0001), factor VIII (P < 0.0000001), factor XI (P < 0.000003), homocysteine (P < 0.014) and fibrinogen (P  = 0.00007). Patients with Buerger's disease also showed higher median plasma levels of urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA) (P < 0.000004), its receptor (uPAR) (P < 0.0008) and uPA complex with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (uPA-PAI-1) P < 0.000006). In contrast, plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein A and folic acid were lower in patients with TAO than in control (P < 0.004 and P < 0.0006; respectively). Higher plasminogen (P < 0.05) and cholesterol (P < 0.003), as well as lower folic acid (P < .0.05) levels were noted in the smokers group than in nonsmoking patients. We found higher plasminogen (P < 0.05), factor VII (P < 0.05), total lipids (P < 0.003), cholesterol (P < 0.05) and triglycerides (P < 0.002) levels in patients requiring surgical treatment for limb-threatening ischaemia than the patients treated only conservatively. These findings suggest an important role of haemostatic risk factors in the pathogenesis of Buerger's disease, with special regard to hyperhomocysteinemia that might be aggravated by  low serum folic acid level. In patients with aggressive clinical course, disturbances in serum lipids were more pronounced. Further studies are warranted  to establish whether diet supplementation of folic acid as well as normalization  of lipids balance might influence the clinical course of TAO.

AB  - We have studied the pressure-induced phase transitions from NaCl-type (B1) to CsCl-type (B2) structure in BaS, BaSe and BaTe by using ab initio density functional theory computations in the local density approximation. The Buerger and WTM mechanisms were explored by mapping the enthalpy contours in two- and four-dimensional configuration space for the two mechanisms, respectively. Transition pressures for BaS, BaSe and BaTe were determined to be 5.5 GPa, 4.9 GPa and 3.4 GPa, respectively. From these configuration space landscapes, a low enthalpy barrier path was constructed for the transitions to proceed at three different pressures. We obtained barriers of 0.18, 0.16 and 0.15 eV/pair (17.4, 15.4 and 14.5 kJ mol(-1)) for the Buerger mechanism and 0.13, 0.13 and 0.12 eV/pair (12.5, 12.5 and 11.6 kJ mol(-1)) for the WTM mechanism at the transition  pressures for BaS, BaSe and BaTe, respectively, indicating that the WTM mechanism is slightly more favorable in these compounds. We describe the difference between the two mechanisms by differences in their symmetry and atomic coordination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: As angiogenic growth factors can stimulate the development of collateral arteries, a concept called therapeutic angiogenesis, we performed a phase I/IIa open-label clinical trial using intramuscular injection of naked plasmid DNA encoding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We reported long-term evaluation of 2 years after HGF gene therapy in 22 patients with severe peripheral arterial disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with peripheral arterial disease or Buerger disease staged by Fontaine IIb (n=7), III  (n=4), and IV (n=11) were treated with HGF plasmid, either 2 mg or 4 mg x2. Increase in ankle-branchial pressure index >0.1 was observed in 11 of 14 patients (79 %) at 2 years after gene therapy and in 11 of the 17 patients (65%) at 2 months. Reduction in rest pain (>2 cm in visual analog scale) was observed in 9 of 9 patients (100%) at 2 years and in 8 of 13 (62%) patients at 2 months. At 2 years, 9 of 10 (90%) ischemic ulcers reduced by >25%, accompanied by a reduction  in the size of ulcer. Severe complications and adverse effects caused by gene transfer were not detected in any patient throughout the period up to 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study demonstrated long-term efficacy of HGF gene therapy up to 2 years. These findings may be cautiously interpreted to indicate that intramuscular injection of naked HGF plasmid is safe, feasible, and can achieve successful improvement of ischemic limbs as sole therapy.

TI  - Rapid Bravais-lattice determination algorithm for lattice parameters containing large observation errors.
PG  - 525-35
LID - 10.1107/S0108767312024579 [doi]
AB  - A new Bravais-lattice determination algorithm is introduced herein. For error-stable Bravais-lattice determination, Andrews & Bernstein [Acta Cryst. (1988), A44, 1009-1018] proposed the use of operations to search for nearly Buerger-reduced cells. Although these operations play an essential role in their  method, they increase the computation time, in particular when lattice parameters obtained in (powder) auto-indexing are supposed to contain large errors. The new  algorithm requires only several permutation matrices in addition to the operations that are necessary when the lattice parameters have exact values. As a result, the computational efficiency of error-stable Bravais-lattice determination is improved considerably. Furthermore, the new method is proved to  be error stable under a very general assumption. The detailed algorithms and the  set of matrices sufficient for error-stable determination are presented.

AB  - Buerger disease is a limb-threatening condition occurring in young smokers, and its treatment has been a challenging problem, although a large number of medical  and surgical options have been suggested. Combined surgery for revascularization  and free-tissue transfer for Buerger disease is an aggressive and attractive option. This complex surgery enables successful treatment of tissue loss caused by ischemia. We performed revascularization and free-tissue transfer to the critically ischemic limb in a patient with Buerger disease. In this case, the procedure is attempted to salvage a limb from amputation.

AB  - In 1878, Winiwarter used a microscope and reported a case of 57 year-old man demonstrating Buerger disease. After that, 134 years passed. Leo Buerger and Edgar V. Allen strongly suggested that Buerger disease is an infectious disease without any doubt. Also, an etiologic point is the luminal infectious thrombus, which is thought to be the core of the disease. Many etiological factors were proposed and then discarded after academic scrutiny, but two big discoveries were made in 2005 and 2008. Namely, periodontal bacteria DNA was found in the occluded arteries of 93% of patients with Buerger disease, and periodontal bacteria (typical weak bacteria) were found to dwell in the platelets. Using these evidences, supported by genetic and epidemiological facts, we could almost explain the pathogenesis or clinical course of Buerger disease, which had been already studied.

AB  - Three of four (75%) vein biopsy samples from four patients (all male, mean onset: age 33.0, mean biopsy: age 59.7) of chronic phase phlebitis migrans showed positive periodontal bacteria DNA under the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method. Of the 24 cases of Buerger disease (22 males, 2 females, mean onset: age  31.9, mean examination: age 62.6) that were investigated in our vascular laboratory, 65% of the patients suffered from moderate to severe varicose veins.  Eight cases had a history of phlebitis migrans and three had an active ulcer or uncontrollable erosion in the foot. The rate of incidence was significantly higher than that of the well-matched control group. Other findings included one instance of deep vein thrombosis, and one instance of deep vein reflux. We could  suggest that some intractable ulcer or erosion cases of Buerger disease may be complicated by superficial vein incompetence or other deep vein insufficiency. We also we need to check Buerger disease patients with duplex for vein reflux and other insufficiencies. Treatment of the varicose veins (including elastic stockings) was effective for all of the patients. (English Translation of Jpn J Phlebology 2011; 22: 25-31.).

TI  - Stem cell therapy in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans: assessment of the  long-term clinical outcome and analysis of the prognostic factors.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The clinical benefits of stem cell therapy have been reported in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. However, those studies had no standard reporting system to assess the outcomes, so we made a scoring system and assessed the outcomes of the limbs that underwent whole bone marrow stem cell (WBMSC) therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between July 4 and June 2009, 90 limbs of 67 patients with symptomatic thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) were enrolled. Autologous whole bone marrow was implanted into the limb by intramuscular injections. The primary outcomes were defined by the clinical and angiographic improvement in all the limbs and the secondary outcomes were the clinical improvement and the amputation-free rates in the critical ischemic limbs (CILs). Clinical improvement and angiographic improvement was observed in 55.6% and 43.2% of all the limbs and in 50% and 50%of the CILs, respectively. The 1, 3  and 5-year amputation-free rates were 91.9%, 88.5% and 84.6% for all the limbs, respectively, and 83.9%, 77.5% and 70.4% for the CILs, respectively. A history of sympathectomy/sympathetic block was shown to be a negative prognostic factor for  clinical improvement in all the limbs and in the CILs. In addition, a history of  sympathetic block/sympathectomy and the smoking state were the major predictors of amputation for the CILs. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that autologous WMBSC therapy improves the clinical status and reduces amputation factors in the  limbs with symptomatic TAO and a history of sympathetic block/sympathectomy and the smoking state are useful prognostic factors.

PG  - 1839-41
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2011.06.111 [doi]
AB  - Femoral-anterior tibial artery bypasses with autogenous grafts are difficult to perform when sufficiently long saphenous veins are not available. We performed 12 bypasses on patients with Buerger disease during a 20-year period using a new intermuscular tunneling technique. The graft is passed from the thigh between the muscle compartments without penetrating the muscle fibers, providing an anatomically superior and shorter path. The primary patency rates were 75% at 5 years and 65% at 10 years. We believe that our tunneling technique is safe and durable and might be a viable alternative for proximal femoral-anterior tibial artery bypass in selected patients.

LID - 10.1007/s00064-011-0041-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A knee disarticulation or a through-knee stump is superior compared to a transfemoral stump. The thigh muscles are all preserved, and the muscle balance remains undisturbed. The range of motion of the hip joint is not limited. The bulbous shape of the stump allows full weight bearing at the stump end and can easily be fitted with a prosthesis. An amputee with a bilateral knee disarticulation is able to walk "barefoot". INDICATIONS: A more distal amputation level, e.g., an ultra-short transtibial amputation, is not possible. Important alternative to transfemoral amputations. Possible for any etiology except for Buerger-Winiwarter's disease. New indications are infected and loosened total knee replacements. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Preservation of the knee joint is possible. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Knee disarticulation is a very atraumatic procedure, compared to transfemoral amputations. Neither bones nor muscles have to be severed, just skin, ligaments, vessels, and nerves. Even the meniscal cartilages may be left in place to act as axial shock absorbers. The cartilage of the femur is not resected, but only bevelled in case of osteoarthritis. There are no tendon attachments or myoplastic procedures necessary. The patella remains in place and  is held in position only by the retinacula. Skin closure must be performed without the slightest tension, and if possible not in the weight-bearing area. Transcondylar amputations across the femoral condyles only are indicated when there are not sufficient soft tissues for wound closure of a knee disarticulation. Alternatives as the techniques of Gritti, Klaes, and Eigler, the shortening of the femur and the Sauerbruch's rotation plasty [14] are presented and discussed. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: The risk of decubital ulcers is rather high. Correct bandaging of the stump is, therefore, particularly important. Prosthetic fitting is possible 3-6 weeks after surgery. The type of prosthesis depends on the amputee's activity level. RESULTS: The superior performance of amputees with knee disarticulations in sports prove the superiority of that amputation level compared to transfemoral amputees. However, because less than 5% of amputations are knee disarticulations, statements about statistical significance cannot be made. On the other hand, one should do everything to preserve an ultra-short transtibial stump.

TI  - [Forefoot and midfoot amputations].
PG  - 254-64
LID - 10.1007/s00064-011-0038-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Partial foot amputations are feasible regardless of the causal condition, including peripheral vascular disease with a few exceptions. Compared  to higher amputation levels, a good foot stump permits full end bearing and enables the patient, even with a hindfoot stump, to walk without the need for a prosthesis. The more peripheral the amputation level selected, the greater the need for gentle tissue handling and meticulous postoperative care, but also the greater the risk of a breakdown requiring stump revision surgery. In the forefoot, partial amputation of the metatarsals preserves the length of the stump and, thus, minimizes the loss of weight-bearing surface. The resection of metatarsal and midfoot bones without removing the toes, called a "hidden" amputation, is more acceptable to the patient who does not feel as if he/she has  become an amputee. In addition, no neuroma or phantom pain is experienced. Biomechanically, this amputation hardly differs from a classical amputation. INDICATIONS: Amputation cannot be avoided by any conservative or operative means. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Absolute: rapidly progressing peripheral arterial diseases, i.e., Buerger-Winiwarter's disease. Relative: renal failures requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Patient in prone position, keep foot and calf free, protect heel from pressure. Mark the skin incisions. A long plantar flap covers the bones and is sutured to the short dorsal flap at the dorsum of the foot. Begin with the dorsal incision down to the bones. After separating the bones, turn the distal part down and separate the plantar soft tissue flap. The bones are well aligned and shaped. Longitudinal amputations preserve a larger load-bearing surface and, therefore, are preferred, if possible. Another alternative is the "hidden" amputation. Except for amputations  in peripheral vascular diseases, the digits and their neurovascular supplies are  preserved. Only the bones are resected, from transmetatarsal to Chopart. The toes will retract within a few weeks. The patients do not feel as if she/he has become an amputee, although the biomechanics of the foot are about the same as after a total amputation. In case of infection, wound debridement, open wound treatment,  and delayed primary closure are recommended. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Full plantar weight bearing in plaster cast or walker is possible 4-6 weeks after surgery. In the case of diabetic foot, healing can require weeks. Total contact prosthesis without limiting the range of motion (ROM) of the ankle and the subtalar joint after 6 weeks. Best results are obtained with prostheses using the silicone technique. Alternative: orthopedic footwear. RESULTS: It is desirable to maintain the greatest length possible; wound healing disorders are observed in over half of all cases. Operative stump corrections are justified in 20-30%; a transtibial amputation is seldom necessary.

TI  - Flow-mediated vasodilation is augmented in a corkscrew collateral artery compared with that in a native artery in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease).
PG  - 1689-97
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2011.05.095 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A healthy endothelium maintains vascular tone and structure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate endothelial function in corkscrew collateral arteries in Buerger disease. METHODS: We measured flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in corkscrew arteries in 26 patients with Buerger disease, in  control arteries in 26 healthy subjects, and in native arteries in 16 patients with Buerger disease. RESULTS: Hyperemic flow was lower in corkscrew arteries than in native arteries in patients with Buerger disease and in control arteries  in healthy subjects. There was no significant difference between hyperemic flow in patients with Buerger disease in whom measurements were performed in native arteries and that in healthy subjects. FMD was lower in corkscrew arteries and native arteries in patients with Buerger disease than in control arteries in healthy subjects. There was no significant difference between FMD in corkscrew arteries in patients with Buerger disease and in that in native arteries. The ratio of FMD to hyperemic flow was significantly smaller in native arteries in patients with Buerger disease than in corkscrew arteries and in control arteries  in healthy subjects (5.5 +/- 6.2 vs 8.8 +/- 8.9 and 9.6 +/- 7.6 mL/min, P < .001, respectively). There was no significant difference in the ratio of FMD to hyperemic flow between corkscrew arteries in Buerger disease and control arteries in healthy subjects. Nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation was similar in all leg arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial function of a corkscrew collateral artery in patients with Buerger disease is maintained, while endothelial function is impaired in a native artery in Buerger disease.

TI  - Management of thromboangiitis obliterans using distraction osteogenesis: A retrospective study.
PG  - 459-64
LID - 10.4103/0019-5413.83954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger disease, is characterized by thrombosis in medium-sized arteries and veins along with a marked inflammatory response. TAO can be managed by using the principle of distraction osteogenesis to induce neoangiogenesis. We report thirty patients of  TAO in the age-group of 20-50 years were treated with the Ilizarov method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe rest pain (n=30), absent distal pulsation (n=30) and ulcer (n=6) and/or gangrene of the toes (n=4), who had failed the conservative pharmacological modalities of treatment were included. A  lateral tibial corticotomy was performed and distraction applied by use of olive  wire. A two-ring frame was used for all cases. RESULTS: Of the 30 cases, 25 patients became pain free while 1 had partial relief of pain. The four patients worsened on treatment and developed frank infection were amputed. The average distraction was 1.8+/-0.3 mm (range: 1.5-2.2 cm). The mean consolidation period was 98+/-11 days, after which the fixator was removed. The total duration of treatment was 122+/-23 days. There were two cases of osteomyelitis in our series; both healed after debridement and both patients had good result, with relief of pain. The ulcers started healing by 4-6 weeks. CONCLUSION: The principle of the distraction osteogenesis including neoangiogenesis can be used for treatment of TAO and has an acceptable complication rate.

TI  - Effectiveness of bosentan in the treatment of ischemic lesions in a case of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease): a case report.
PG  - 4
AB  - Buerger disease or thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a thrombotic occlusive, non-atherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease that affects the small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the extremities of the limbs, frequently requiring amputation. Cessation of tobacco use is the only known effective treatment, though preliminary results from the use of pharmacological therapy implicated in pathogenesis of TAO have demonstrated noticeable clinical improvement of patients. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with active TAO, refractory to smoking cessation and conventional therapy, who exhibited a favorable clinical response to treatment with bosentan, an oral dual endothelin receptor antagonist, administered on a compassionate-use basis. Six months after  starting bosentan therapy, the pain and trophic lesions in the patient's toes had completely disappeared. Bosentan was well tolerated, without any observed adverse reaction. The findings of this case report suggest that bosentan may be considered a therapeutic option for patients with active disease, despite quitting smoking, or for those who fail in absolute abstention from smoking.

TI  - Reconstruction of the soft tissue defects of foot and ankle with neural-island flaps: mono-institutional case series.
PG  - 403-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1281514 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this report is to show the results obtained from using the neural-island flap to cover the soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle. This is the first report of the neural-island flap series since the introduction of this flap to the literature in 2003. Between 2002 and 2009 "neural-island flap" was used to treat 20 patients of various lesions on the foot and ankle. All of the patients had serious soft tissue defects that compromised tendons, bones, or  joints. In 16 patients, the tissue defects were completely and successfully covered with an uncomplicated postoperative course. In 4 patients the flaps presented venous congestion and intermittent bleeding and leech application was performed for 2 to 3 days postoperatively. Two of these flaps healed completely without any flap loss. In one patient because the partial flap necrosis occurred  in distal one-fourth of the flap, skin grafting was performed after 1 week of vacuum-assisted closure application. Total flap necrosis occurred in only one patient who was suffering from Buerger disease. The authors conclude that the neural-island flap is a highly versatile, easy, and reproducible flap that avoids the use of complicated and risky reconstruction options. It can be considered as  an alternative reconstruction option particularly in problematic cases that are not suitable for local or free tissue transfers.

TI  - Spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of Buerger disease: a report on 3 cases.
PG  - 819-23
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0b013e31821d8eff [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Buerger disease (or thromboangeiitis obliterans) is an inflammatory disease of the medium and small caliber arteries and veins that predominantly affects young males and presents with ischemia in the hands or the feet. It is closely associated with smoking. Critical ischemia of the lower limbs is a threat to the survival of the patient s extremities, and often disables its victims severely. This takes on an even greater significance in younger individuals who are still actively employed, as is the case in patients suffering from Buerger disease. Our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of the spinal cord stimulation as an alternative therapeutic option in acute stages of Buerger disease. RESULTS AND METHODS: We present a case series of males under the age of 45 years, diagnosed with thromboangeiitis obliterans and all of them were in the acute phase of the disease. They were satisfactorily treated with an implantable spinal cord stimulation device. DISCUSSION: Spinal cord stimulation is an accepted therapy for the treatment of chronic ischemic pain and ulcer healing and to avoid amputation in patients with severe, nonrevascularisable peripheral occlusive arteriopathy, and specially in the subgroup of patients with Buerger disease. It  should not only be considered as a last resort strategy for pain control, but as  a valid therapeutic option to improve perfusion of the limbs in the initial stages of the disease, however larger studies still remain necessary.

AB  - Buerger disease (BD) and Takayasu arteritis (TA) are rare vascular disorders. Although their etiology and pathogenesis have not been elucidated, several studies have suggested the involvement of innate immunity. Myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) is a key signaling adaptor for all Toll-like receptors, which have a central role in innate immunity. In the present study, we evaluated the association of MyD88 with BD and TA. We conducted case-control studies in Japanese populations composing of 131 BD cases, 90 TA cases and 270 healthy controls to be genotyped for a single nucleotide polymorphism rs7744 A>G in the 3'-untranslated region of MyD88 gene. The frequency of GG genotype was significantly lower in the BD patients than in the controls (6.9 vs 15.9%, P=0.011, odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence interval; 0.19,  0.81), although there was no significant difference in the genotype frequencies between the TA patients and controls. It was suggested that MyD88 may confer resistance to BD in Japanese. Because this is the first report of the association between MyD88 and BD, replication studies in other cohorts are required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone-marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) implantation improves ischemic  symptoms in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes after autologous BM-MNC implantation  in patients with CLI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed long-term clinical outcomes after BM-MNC implantation in 51 patients with CLI, including 25 patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and 26 patients with Buerger disease. Forty-six CLI patients who had no BM-MNC implantation served as control subjects. Median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 4-year amputation-free rates after BM-MNC implantation were 48% in PAD patients and 95% in Buerger disease, and they were 0% in control PAD patients and 6% in control Buerger disease. The 4-year overall survival rates after BM-MNC implantation were 76% in PAD patients and 100% in Buerger disease, and they were 67% in control PAD patients and 100% in control Buerger disease. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that BM-MNC implantation correlated with prevention of major amputation and that  hemodialysis and diabetes mellitus correlated with major amputation. In Buerger disease, ankle brachial pressure index and transcutaneous oxygen pressure were significantly increased after 1 month and remained high during 3-year follow-up.  However, in patients with PAD, ankle brachial pressure index and transcutaneous oxygen pressure significantly increased after 1 month and gradually decreased during 3-year follow-up and returned to baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BM-MNC implantation is safe and effective in patients with  CLI, especially in patients with Buerger disease.

TI  - Trace elements and toxic heavy metals play a role in Buerger disease and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
PG  - 489-95
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to define the roles of trace elements and toxic heavy metals in Buerger disease and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). METHODS: Seventy-five subjects who were identical in demographic charecteristics were selected for the study; 25 with Buerger disease, 25 with PAOD, 25 healthy volunteers. Serum selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe),whole blood cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), erythrocyte glutathione (GSH),  erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), erythrocyte and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. RESULTS: Serum Se and Zn levels were  significantly low in patients with Buerger disease compared to patients with PAOD and controls (P<0.001 and P<0.001 respectively). Serum levels of Fe and Zn were also significantly low in patients with PAOD compared to controls (p<0.001 and p<0.05 respectively). In contrast, Cu and Pb levels in Buerger disease group were significantly high compared to PAOD and control groups (P<0.001 and P<0.001 respectively). Erythrocyte GSH and GSH-Px levels were significantly lower in patients with Buerger disease compared to patients with PAOD and controls (P<0.001 and P<0.001 respectively), while erythrocyte and plasma MDA levels were  significantly higher (P<0.001 and P<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the levels of trace elments and toxic heavy metals and oxidative stress influence the disease process in Buerger disease more than PAOD.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans, or Buerger disease, is a debilitating vascular disease with a well-known pronounced link to cigarette smoking and, more specifically, to the nicotine component of tobacco inhalation. Buerger disease is an inflammatory occlusive disorder that primarily affects the medium and small vessels of the extremities. In the present case report, a 46-year-old man, nonforthcoming smoker, presented to the authors' clinic with a deep ulcer at the  head of the second metatarsal. Evidently, although the patient continued to smoke, the ulcer responded to therapy but regressed. Once the history was elaborated, the patient stopped smoking, and the ulcer healed completely within 2 months. Follow-up appointments proved to be unremarkable and to the authors' knowledge, there has not been a reoccurrence, and the patient remains tobacco-free.

TI  - Cornus kousa F.Buerger ex Miquel increases glucose uptake through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and insulin sensitization.
PG  - 803-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2010.11.007 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Cornus kousa F.Buerger ex Miquel, an oriental medicinal plant,  has been traditionally used for the treatment of hyperglycemia, but its molecular mechanism remains unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligand-binding activity of Cornus kousa and to determine the effects of Cornus kousa on insulin  sensitization in 3T3-L1 cells for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PPARgamma luciferase transactivation assay was used to evaluate the PPARgamma ligand-binding activity of Cornus kousa leaf extract. Western blot analysis, oil Red O staining, and glucose uptake assay were performed to evaluate PPARgamma agonistic activity and insulin sensitizing effects of Cornus kousa leaf extract (CKE) in 3T3-L1 cells. RESULTS: CKE increased PPARgamma ligand-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, CKE enhanced adipogenesis and the expression of PPARgamma target proteins, including glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and adiponectin, as well as proteins involved in adipogenesis, including  PPARgamma and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, CKE led to significant induction of glucose uptake and stimulated insulin signaling, but not to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. The enhanced glucose uptake by CKE were abolished by treatment with bisphenol a diglycidyl ether (BADGE), a PPARgamma antagonist, or LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), but not by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. CONCLUSION: Consistent with the high PPARgamma ligand-binding activity, CKE increased glucose uptake through PPARgamma activation and insulin signaling. These results suggest that CKE could have pharmacological effects for the treatment of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes.

TI  - [Systemic vasculitis: study of 27 cases in Senegal].
PG  - 264-6
AB  - Studies on vasculitis in black Africa are rare. The purpose of this report is to  describe a retrospective study of systemic vasculitis managed in the internal medicine, ORL and cardiolology departments of the Aristide le Dantec University Hospital in Dakar, Senegal from 1995 to 2007. A series of 27 cases involving 7 men and 20 women with a mean age of 49 years was compiled. Primary vasculitis included Horton disease in 3 cases, Wegener disease in 2, Takayasu disease in 1,  and Buerger disease in 1. Secondary vasculitis included mixed cryoglobulinemia with Gougerot Sjogren syndrome in 7 cases, primary Goujerot syndrome in 4, rheumatoid arthritis in 3, nodosa periarteritis with hepatitis B in 2, SHARP syndrome in 1, and polymyositis in 1. The remaining two cases involved abdominal  periaortitis including one associated with retrosperitoneal fibrosis and tuberculosis and the other with spondylarthropathy. Corticotherapy in combination with anticoagulants, immunosuppressive therapy, and surgery, when necessary, allowed effective management in 24 cases. The findings of this study show that systemic vasculitis can have numerous etiologies and indicate that secondary forms are the most common. Appropriate care modalities are needed to prevent severe outcome in Senegalese hospitals.

AB  - Periodontitis is characterized by gingival inflammation and periodontopathic bacteria generate immunological inflammatory responses. Recent epidemiological reports suggest that periodontitis is one of the key risk factors for the onset of cardiovascular diseases. Several studies reported that periodontal bacteria in cardiovascular specimens were frequently detected. We revealed that patients with acute coronary syndrome showed significantly higher serum IgG titers to a strain  of periodontopathic bacteria compared with patients with chronic coronary disease. Periodontopathic bacteria were also present in a high percentage of specimens of diseased arteries from patients with Buerger disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Although periodontopathic bacteria may play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, the influence of these bacteria on the disease has not yet been proven. In this article, we review the relationship between periodontopathic pathogens and cardiovascular diseases to conduct further clinical and experimental investigations in near future.

AB  - CT angiography (CTA) of the lower extremities has evolved into a robust noninvasive angiographic technique with the advent of 16 and 64 multidetector computed tomographic systems and advances in system design. CTA has displaced conventional catheter arteriography in a large range of applications and is predominantly used in the evaluation of atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease in symptomatic patients who are candidates for intervention. Other disease entities including atheroembolism and thromboembolism, aneurysmal disease, and arteritides including Buerger disease and Takayasu arteritis can be  precisely evaluated by CTA. Particular applications include arterial vascular mapping for free flap transfers and fibular grafts and evaluation of trauma, before and following orthopedic and plastic surgery interventions. Patients with  intravascular stents and arterial bypass grafts who usually undergo serial evaluation by noninvasive, nonangiographic testing are potential candidates for angiographic study when clinical findings of noninvasive tests are in disagreement. The key to a successful clinical application is in understanding how to acquire, display, and interpret high-quality CTA in diverse clinical circumstances.

TI  - Fifteen years of infrapopliteal arterial reconstructions with cryopreserved venous allografts for limb salvage.
PG  - 869-77
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2009.11.062 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The availability of autologous vein grafts remains the limiting factor in infragenual bypass surgery in many patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Alternatives such as prosthetic conduits are known to have a poor outcome and most are not resistant to infection. Based on previous experimental work, we started to use cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts for this indication 15 years ago. To evaluate their outcome, we performed a retrospective study of those bypasses with distal anastomosis on a crural or pedal vessel. METHODS: Between November 1991 and December 2005, 108 cryopreserved great saphenous vein allografts were implanted for in 92 patients (42 women, 50 men) with a mean age of 71 years (range, 39-88 years). All patients received low-dose immunosuppressive therapy for up to 1 year after intervention. Follow-up was conducted until amputation, death, or the end of the study in March 2007. RESULTS: Nondiabetic atherosclerosis the cause of CLI in 57%, 41% had diabetes, and 2% had Buerger disease. Forty-one conduits were performed for primary reconstructions and 67 for redo reconstructions. During a mean follow-up of 26.4  months, 69 occlusions occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 56% and  73% at 1 year, 32% and 60% at 3 years, and 17% and 38.5% at 5 years. Survival rates were 87.4% at 1 year and 64.5% at 5 years. At multivariate analysis, the intake of statins was predictive for improved patency (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; P = .024) and for prolonged survival (HR, 0.335; P = .045). The presence of diabetes showed a trend for inferior patency (HR, 2.325; P = .116) and for decreased amputation risk (HR, 0.592; P = .078). CONCLUSION: Cryopreserved saphenous vein allografts are a valuable alternative to prosthetic materials when autologous veins are not available. Our limb salvage and patency rates are higher then those described for prosthetic grafts at the infrapopliteal level in most studies. Moreover, these grafts are resistant to infection when performed for revascularization in patients with an infected ulcer. Better graft and patient selection, better graft surveillance and immunologic matching, and standard use of statins could possibly improve the results even further. Shortage in availability might be a limiting factor for their widespread use.

TI  - [New aspects in diagnosis and treatment of obliterating thromboangiitis (Buerger  disease)].
PG  - 175-83
AB  - The nature of arterial occlusive lesions in young smokers is an object of continuous debate commencing from 1879 when Winiwarter for the first time described a vascular syndrome which he called <<obliterating endarteritis>>. However, in 1908 Buerger published his works hav.' lg become classical and then his monograph (1924) dedicated to this disease for which he used a new name <<obliterating thromboangiitis>> which further on became a generally accepted term. Diagnosis of obliterating thromboangiitis was made very often in the past.  The occurrence of this disease is considerably lower nowadays than 20 or 30 years ago; therefore, the last 10-15 years have witnessed no publication of serious works on this subject. It should be underlined that obliterating thromboangiitis  is an independent disease differing fundamentally from atherosclerosis with considerably less frequent occurrence.

TI  - Targeting nonhealing ulcers of lower extremity in human through autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
PG  - 359-66
LID - 10.1089/rej.2009.0872 [doi]
AB  - Bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising population for supporting new concepts in cellular therapy. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and feasibility of autologous BM-derived MSCs in the treatment of chronic nonhealing ulcers (diabetic foot ulcers and Buerger disease) of the lower extremities. A total of 24 patients with nonhealing ulcers  of the lower limb were enrolled and randomized into implant and control groups. In the implant group, the patients received autologous cultured BM-derived MSCs along with standard wound dressing; the control group received only the standard  wound dressing regimen, followed up for at least a 12-week period. Wound size, pain-free walking distance, and biochemical parameters were measured before therapy and at every 2-week interval following intervention. The implant group had significant improvement in pain-free walking distance and reduction in ulcer  size as compared to those in the control group. In the implant group for Buerger  disease, the ulcer area decreased from 5.04 +/- 0.70 cm(2) to 1.48 +/- 0.56 cm(2) (p < 0.001), whereas the pain-free walking distance increased from 38.33 +/- 17.68 m to 284.44 +/- 212.12 m (p < 0.001). In the diabetic foot ulcer group, the ulcer size decreased from 7.26 +/- 1.41 cm(2) to 2 +/- 0.98 cm(2) (p < 0.001) at  12 weeks. Mononuclear cells were cultured for a minimum of five passages and characterized by cell-surface markers showing CD90+, CD105+, and CD34(-). There was no significant alteration in the biochemical parameters observed during the follow-up period, indicating normal liver and renal function following intervention. Biopsy microsection of implanted tissues showed development of dermal cells (mainly fibroblasts), including mature and immature inflammatory cells. The study indicates that autologous implantation of BM-derived MSCs in nonhealing ulcers accelerates the healing process and improves clinical parameters significantly.

PG  - 373-81
LID - 10.1016/j.avsg.2009.07.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the mid-term outcome of distal venous arterialization (DVA) and the role of a combined free flap as a bridgehead for blood supply. METHODS: In the past 5 years, nine patients with extensive tissue loss and lacking graftable distal arteries underwent DVA. These consisted of four primary  DVAs, three combined DVA and free flap procedures, and two adjuvant DVAs for hemodynamically failed distal bypasses. After nine primary DVAs, three redo DVAs  were performed for early failure. Etiologies were four Buerger disease and five arteriosclerosis obliterans, including three dialysis patients. RESULTS: Among the nine DVA cases, there were five primary failures: two underwent amputation, two had successful redo DVA, and the remaining one did not require redo DVA. Primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were 44.4%, 55.6%, and 77.8%, respectively. The postoperative period was 1-36 months (median 12). Angiography demonstrated DVA was effective in the early period, and development of collaterals or a capillary network from the free flap replaced the DVA function in the intermediate period. CONCLUSION: DVA can be effective as a procedure for limb salvage in patients without graftable distal arteries, and a combined free flap is effective and functions as a bridgehead for blood supply to the ischemic zone.

AB  - AIM: Anti-cardiolipin (CL) antibodies can be induced in Buerger disease (BD), an  inflammatory occlusive disorder affecting peripheral blood vessels, in response to bacteria bearing homology to the TLRVYK peptide of a phospholipid-binding plasma protein beta-2-glycoprotein I. TLRVYK homologies are present in Porphyromonas gingivalis (TLRIYT) and Treponema denticola (TLALYK). This study investigated the association between periodontal infection and anti-CL antibodies in BD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Periodontal conditions were examined in 19  BD patients and 25 systemically healthy control subjects. All subjects were heavy smokers. Serum anti-CL, anti-TLRVYK, anti-TLRIYT, and anti-TLALYK antibodies were assessed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: BD patients had a  significantly higher prevalence of periodontitis, more severe periodontal destruction and increased titres of serum anti-CL, anti-TLRVYK, anti-TLRIYT, and  anti-TLALYK antibodies compared with healthy subjects. The levels of anti-CL antibodies positively correlated with those of the three anti-peptide antibodies. Anti-CL antibody titres were significantly associated with the percentage of sites with clinical attachment level >or=4 mm in BD patients. CONCLUSION: Elevated anti-CL antibody levels were associated with periodontal destruction in  BD patients. Periodontopathic bacteria may serve as exogenous antigens that stimulate the anti-CL antibody production through molecular mimicry between the bacterial peptides and a host plasma protein.

AB  - We have studied the pressure induced B1-B2 phase transition within the Buerger mechanism. A transition path was generated using roots of the transition matrix between the B1 and the B2 structure. The enthalpies of activation [Formula: see text] were obtained for this path for the typical examples of NaCl and of CaO from first principle calculations. The results were compared to [Formula: see text]-values for optimized transition paths either reported in the literature or  obtained from our own test calculations. They were very similar to the values obtained from the matrix root method. The latter method is, however, computationally very efficient because no optimization procedure of the transition path is necessary.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger disease, is a segmental occlusive inflammatory disorder of the arteries and veins, and etiopathogenesis is still obscure. It is strongly connected to the use of tobacco products, especially smoking. Smoking cessation is obligatory for success of the medical treatment. In the current study, we investigated the prevalence of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 894 G-->T and endothelin-1 (ET-1) 8000 T-->C polymorphisms in association with TAO to reveal any possible involvement in the TAO pathophysiology. The T allele of the eNOS 894 G-->T polymorphism was found to be  associated with the prevention of TAO.

AB  - Background. Buerger disease is a nonatherosclerotic, segmental, occlusive and recurrent inflammatory vascular disorder that affects small and medium-sized arteries and veins of the upper and lower extremities. Case reports. We report two cases of Buerger disease. Medical History. Smoking habit. No autoimmune diseases. No diabetes mellitus. Intermittent vascular claudication at 100-150 m.  Several hospital admissions for amputations. Prior Medical Treatment. Antiplatelet agents, vasodilators, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, third-step analgesics, fibrinolytic treatment and lumbar sympathectomies. Following all of the above treatments, Synergy((R)) spinal cord (ECP) stimulator  with two electrodes (Quad PISCES((c)) ) placed at the level of T9-T10. Results. There has been a reduction in pain of about 80% and an improvement of intermittent claudication (one of the patients no longer claudicates, whereas the other patient claudicates at 400 m). Conclusion. Neurostimulation of the posterior funiculi could be considered not only as palliative care but also as a  therapeutic option.

TI  - [Clinical application of skin sympathetic nerve activity].
PG  - 243-53
AB  - Skin sympathetic nerve activity (SSNA) is microneurographically recorded from the skin nerve fascicle in the peripheral nerves. It is characterized by the following features: 1) irregular, pulse asynchronous, burst activity with respiratory variation, 2) burst activity followed by vasoconstriction and/or sweating, 3) elicited by mental stress and arousal stimuli, e.g., sound, pain, electric stimulation, 4) burst with longer duration as compared with sympathetic  outflow to muscles, and 5) burst activity following sudden inspiratory action. It comprises vasoconstrictor (VC) and sudomotor(SM) activity, as well as vasodilator (VD) activity. VC and SM discharge independently, whereas VD is the same activity with different neurotransmission. The VC and SM are differentiated by effector response, e.g., laser Doppler flowmetry and skin potential changes. SSNA function in thermoregulation in the human body; however it is also elicited by mental stress. SSNA is the lowest at thermoneutral ambient temperature (approximately 27 degrees C), and is enhanced in the pressence of ambient warm and cool air. The burst amplitude is well-correlated to both skin blood flow reduction rate or sweat rate change. The clinical application of SSNA comprises the following: 1) clarification of sweating phenomenon, 2) clarification and diagnosis of anhidrosis, 3) clarification and diagnosis of hyperhidrosis, 4) clarification of  thermoregulatory function and diagnosis of thermoregulatory disorder, 5) clarification of pathophysiology and diagnosis of vascular diseases, e.g., Raynaud and Buerger diseases. 6) clarification of the relation between cognitive  function and SSNA and 7) determination of pharmacological effect attributable to  change in neuroeffector responses.

TI  - [Vascular regeneration therapy for intractable vasculitis].
PG  - 612-8
AB  - The field of cell-based transplantation has expanded considerably and is poised to become an established cardiovascular therapy in the near future. In this review, we will focus on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are immature  cells capable of differentiating into mature endothelial cells (ECs). The major source of EPCs is the bone marrow (BM). BM-derived EPCs are mobilized into peripheral blood and recruited to the foci of pathophysiological neovascularization and reendothelialization, thereby contributing to vascular regeneration. Severe EPC dysfunction is an indicator of poor prognosis and severe endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, number of circulating EPCs and their migratory activity are reduced in patients with diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD) or  subjects with multiple coronary risk factors. Effective neovascularization induced by EPC transplantation for hindlimb, myocardial and cerebral ischemia has been demonstrated in many preclinical studies, and early clinical trials of EPC transplantation in chronic and acute CAD as well as Buerger disease indicate safety and feasibility of the cell-based therapies. Further development in cell processing technology for efficient isolation, expansion, mobilization, recruitment and transplantation of EPCs into target tissues are underway and expected to be tested in clinical trials in the near future.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the status and the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in patients with Buerger disease and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Seventy-three subjects resembling each other in general characteristics were involved in the study: 21 with lower extremity PAOD (mean age 53.05 +/- 10.8 years, 17 men and four women), 22 with Buerger disease (mean age 38.59 +/- 6.4 years, 19 men and three women), and 30 healthy volunteers (mean age 38.59 +/- 6.4 years, 22 men and eight women). We measured the levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), paraoxonase (PON1), protein carbonyls, arylesterase, nitric oxide (NO), serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and MDA, glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GSH-red), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in erythrocytes. Plasma protein carbonyls, serum ox-LDL, and plasma and erythrocyte MDA were significantly high in the Buerger disease group compared to the PAOD and control groups (p < 0.001). Plasma PON1 levels and GSH and GSH-px levels in erythrocytes in the Buerger disease group were significantly low compared to the PAOD and control groups (p < 0.001). GSH-red, SOD, and CAT levels in erythrocytes in the Buerger disease group were significantly lowcompared to the PAOD group (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). NO levels were significantly lower in the PAOD group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity is more seriously impaired in Buerger disease than PAOD.

AB  - Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is a non-atherosclerotic segmental inflammatory disease strongly associated with tobacco use, and it affects small and medium-sized blood vessels in the upper and lower extremities. The only known treatment for this disease is complete discontinuation of tobacco use. This report describes the case history of a woman with Buerger disease treated with the oral dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan. It is believed that this is the first description in the literature of this use for bosentan.

TI  - [Buerger's disease: current concepts].
PG  - 33-40
AB  - Buerger's disease or thromboangiitis obliterans is a non atherosclerotic, segmentar inflammatory vasculitis that reaches small and medium size vessels of the limbs's extremities. It affects predominantly young male smokers that present distal ischemia, clinically manifested through claudication, rest pain, ulcers and gangrene. A hundred years after its original description by Leo Buerger, the  disease's etiology remains unclear, but it is acknowledged the importance of tobacco's role for the initiation, progression and prognosis of the pathology. Its incidence has globally declined, despite the relative increment of female cases owing to the crescent number of smoking women. The treatment has suffered a considerable evolution, manifested by the decreasing number of performed amputations, but it should always be followed by complete interruption of the smoking habits - the central attitude of the therapeutics. The introduction of the antagonists of cannabinoid like rimonabant, revealed promising in helping pacients stop smoking. Prostanoids are nowadays an important therapeutic attitude. Sympathectomy and omental transfer are included as surgical therapeutic options. The recent evolution in the discovery of new therapeutic resources in the angiogenesis scope, have opened up new possibilities for the treatment of Buerger's disease, considered one of the least treatable vasculitis.

AB  - We report two cases of acute compartment syndrome in the anterior compartment of  the lower limbs of patients with the diagnosis of Buerger disease associated with positive anticardiolipin antibodies. We comment on the rarity of the case and on  the possibility of interference of two associated thrombogenic conditions. The need for early fasciotomy is emphasized since the progression to necrosis is time dependent. Fasciotomy was the only reperfusion surgery utilized on these patients with resolution of the ischemia.

TI  - [The effects of smoking on cardiovascular system].
PG  - 42-4
AB  - Smoking is a very popular habit of inhaling tobacco smoke. Toxic components of the tobacco smoke are being distributed throughout the whole organism by means of circulation. Nicotine, carbon monoxide, free radicals and cytokines fundamentally influence circulation. These components cause creation of atherosclerotic plaque  and its destabilization. These processes make smoking the most important single risk factor in coronary artery disease, sudden cardiac death, ischemic stroke, aortic aneurysm formation, peripheral vascular disease and Buerger disease. It must be also said this factor might be possibly removed. Epidemiologic examinations confirm that The INTERHEART study showed strongly growing dependence between the number of cigarettes smoked during the day and night and the risk of  coronary heart attack. In order to lower the risk we should mobilize all preventive actions which would protect us from smoking and addiction. But for those who are already chain smokers we should apply behavior therapy or eventually use drugs which are scientifically proved to be effective.

TI  - [Superficial migratory thrombophlebitis: a clinical and histologic review of 8 cases].
PG  - 390-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Superficial migratory thrombophlebitis (SMT) or thrombophlebitis migrans is characterized by recurrent episodes of localized thrombosis of the superficial veins in the limbs and trunk. It has been associated with various systemic diseases that should be taken into consideration when assessing the patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2007, 8 patients with SMT were seen at Hospital General Universitario de Valencia in Valencia, Spain. We review  the clinical features and histopathology, along with the associated diseases. RESULTS: The most common clinical presentation was with painful nodules mimicking erythema nodosum on the lower extremities. Other sites were on the abdomen and trunk. Only in 1 case was SMT diagnosed clinically. In other cases, the clinical  diagnoses were cellulitis, lymphangitis, nodular vasculitis, and panarteritis nodosa. The histologic characteristics were compatible with superficial thrombophlebitis, and orcein staining revealed the internal elastic lamina to be  absent in all cases. No evidence of an occult tumor was found in any of the cases. Two cases had a history of Buerger disease and in another the condition presented in association with a fever of unknown origin. CONCLUSION: The possible association of SMT with systemic diseases, including cancer, makes its diagnosis  important. In our case series we did not find evidence of associated disease in the majority of cases. However, since cancer can manifest months and even years after the appearance of SMT, follow-up is necessary in these patients.

AB  - Oral bacteria have been detected at atherosclerotic plaque, aneurysms, and thrombosed arteries in Buerger disease. We explored a possible relationship between the oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis and arterial thrombosis at proximal and distal sites in rats. Eighteen rats underwent subcutaneous placement of an infusion pump connected to the jugular vein. The Pg infusion group received a continuous infusion of P. gingivalis for 2 weeks, and the controls received normal saline. At 2 and 4 weeks, specimens were obtained from the iliac, superficial, and below-knee arteries, which were studied pathologically and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to detect P. gingivalis-specific DNA. The Pg infusion group had thrombosis in 33.3% at 2 weeks and in 55.6% at 4 weeks, but normal arterial wall structure was preserved without any features of infection. Positive PCR findings were recognized in 73.3% and 22.2% at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. At 4 weeks, thrombosis was observed in a higher proportion,  with the below-knee specimens having an especially high thrombus rate (83.3%). No control specimen had thrombosis or positive PCR results. Bacteremia due to the oral pathogen P. gingivalis may lead to thrombus formation in the peripheral arteries, especially in small-sized arteries.

AB  - Primary hepatic lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type is extremely rare. Only 38 cases have been reported to date. A case of a 59-year-old man with  Helicobacter pylori-resistant gastric ulcers and Buerger disease who was followed up since 1999 is reported. A 2-cm hepatic nodule was incidentally found during partial gastrectomy and corresponded to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue-type lymphoma without underlying liver disease. Molecular studies showed a clonal immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement. Investigations for the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma-associated translocations t(11;18) and t(14;18), as well as the t(3;14)(q27;q32), were negative, whereas trisomy 3 and trisomy 18 were detected.

PG  - 145-9
LID - 10.1097/DAD.0b013e31816407c6 [doi]
AB  - Recently described macular arteritis presents as asymptomatic hyperpigmented macules, runs a chronic, indolent course, and shows lymphocytic arteritis at various stages of evolution ranging from fibrinoid necrosis to endarteritis obliterans. Herein, we present another case that was clinically suspected to be unilateral plantar pompholyx. A 47-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of persistent, reticulated, asymptomatic, nonblanching erythematous and brawny macules, and scattered, slightly scaly papules over the plantar instep of his left foot. Two punch biopsies extending to the subcutis revealed healed arteritis (endarteritis obliterans with fragmented elastic lamina) in the subcutis in one biopsy and purpura and hemosiderin deposition surrounding small subcutaneous arterioles and venules in the second. Additional histologic features included lymphocytic eccrine hidradenitis and chronic spongiotic dermatitis. Extensive laboratory work did not reveal evidence of systemic disease. Despite topical corticosteroid therapy, he has had persistent, asymptomatic disease after 6 months follow-up. The differential diagnoses considered included pigmented purpuric dermatitis, perniosis (chilblains), plantar eccrine hidradenitis, Buerger disease, livedo vasculopathy, and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa also runs a benign course and is denoted by muscular vessel vasculitis, which can resolve with retiform hyperpigmentation. Based on these overlapping clinical-pathologic features, macular arteritis might  represent a latent, non-nodule forming chronic variant of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.

AB  - Weak oral bacteria such as periodontal bacteria or Chlamydia pneumoniae have been observed in various arterial and venous lesions with epidemiological data reported prior to the discovery of bacterial invasion into vessels. Rich lymph vessels easily bring the bacteria from the mouth to the neck and the venous angle, which is directly open to the blood vessels. Periodontal bacteria travel within platelets and Chlamydia pneumoniae can be carried by monocytes. The transportation system of other weak oral bacteria have not been determined. Periodontal bacteria, especially P. gingivalis aggregate platelets and form thrombi. At the same time, secretions such as serotonin, various cytokines, and adhesion factors also appear in the blood. The characteristics of arterial lesions are dependent on the age of the patient and the condition of the endothelial cells. In young patients, infectious incidents occur due to embolic mechanisms in Buerger disease or adhesion to the superficial veins valves in varicose veins. In older patients, incidents result in adhesion in the proximal aorta, coronary arteries, or large arteries. The hypothesis here unifies the evidence on vessel lesion development and explains the possible discrepancy between vascular diseases.

TI  - [Prognostic factors for critical limb ischemia after autologous bone marrow implantation].
PG  - 235-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autologous bone marrow implantation (BMI) is effective to treat critical limb ischemia, but the long-term prognosis is not clear. The outcome of  BMI treatment for ischemic legs was investigated related to the clinical background of the patient, and short-term effects of BMI. The end event was defined as unexpected lower limb amputation. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 21 consecutive patients (mean age 60.0 +/- 13.6 years) with peripheral arterial disease who underwent BMI between December 2001 and March 2005. Twelve patients had arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO), 5 had Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), 3 had thromboembolism, and 1 had hypereosinophilic  syndrome. The patients with ASO had severe complications such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. The total number of transplanted CD34-positive cells, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI), and tissue oxygen pressure (TcO2) were lower in ASO patients than non-ASO patients. Significant risk factors for the event were diagnosis of ASO and low TcO2 (< 30 mmHg) according to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log rank test. All 6 patients who required limb amputation had ASO simultaneously with low TcO2 (6 of 9, 67%). In contrast, there was no correlation between the end event and short-term effect of BMI such as improvements in ABI and TcO2. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with BMI could not save legs in some patients with ASO associated with severe leg ischemia.

TI  - Synergistic contribution of CD14 and HLA loci in the susceptibility to Buerger disease.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - Buerger disease (BD) is an occulusive vascular disease of unknown etiology. Although cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor of BD, genetic factors may also play a role in the etiology. Because chronic bacterial infection such as oral periodontitis is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of BD, gene polymorphisms involved in the infectious immunity might be associated with BD as  the genetic factor(s). We have previously reported that HLA-DRB1*1501 and B54 was associated with BD in Japanese. In this study, polymorphisms in HLA-DPB1, DRB1 and B were analyzed in 131 Japanese BD patients and 227 healthy controls. In addition, we investigated a functional promoter polymorphism, -260 C > T, of CD14 that is a main receptor of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. It was found that the frequencies of CD14 TT genotype [37.4 vs. 24.2%, P = 0.008 OR = 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI); 1.18, 2.97], DRB1*1501 (34.4 vs. 13.2%, P (c) = 4.4 x 10(-5), OR = 3.44, 95%CI; 2.06, 5.73) and DPB1*0501 (79.4 vs. 55.1%, P (c) = 4.7  x 10(-5), OR = 3.14, 95%CI; 1.93, 5.11) were significantly higher in the patients than in the controls, demonstrating that at least three genetic markers were associated with BD. Stratification analyses of these associated markers suggested synergistic roles of the genetic factors. Odds ratios ranged from 4.72 to 12.57 in individuals carrying any two of these three markers. These findings suggested  that the susceptibility to BD was in part controlled by genes involved in the innate and adaptive immunity.

TI  - Smoking and aortic diseases.
PG  - 1173-80
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a major vascular risk factor and in this context, it is an independent risk factor for the development of aortic disease, especially the formation and growth of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Medline was searched up to January 31, 2007 for the relevant literature for this review of the mechanisms by which smoking causes aortic wall damage and its subsequent impact on the clinical manifestation of this process. Idiopathic AAAs and aortic dissection are considered, as well as other aortic diseases (eg, Takayasu, Kawasaki, Behcet and  Buerger). There is evidence suggesting an abnormal homeostasis between proteolytic and antiproteolytic activity in the vascular wall during the development of AAAs, and these mechanisms can be influenced by smoking. Smoking cessation plays an important role in the management of aortic disease.

TI  - Buerger disease in an elderly man.
PG  - 522-4
AB  - Buerger disease is characterized by progressive distal extremity ischemia in persons with recent tobacco consumption. Typically, affected persons are young men. There have been case reports of Buerger disease in older men. Almost all of  the reported cases were characterized with progressive, severe disease requiring  amputation. We report a case of an older man with features of Buerger disease without significant proximal progression despite active smoking. Arteriographic and pathologic studies confirmed the diagnosis.

PG  - 416-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nodular thrombophlebitis is septal hypodermitis characterised by vasculitis with vein thrombosis. It may indicate serious underlying disorders. EXEGESIS: We present two cases of nodular superficial phlebitis, which revealed tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. CONCLUSION: Nodular thrombophlebitis are classic during evolution of Behcet disease or Buerger vasculitis. In sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum and granulomatous involvement are the most common cutaneous manifestation. Nodular thrombophlebitis has never been described. Panniculitis are classical in tuberculosis. But most cases are erythema nodosum and cases of erythema induratum of Bazin. Nodular thrombophlebitis could reveal thrombophilic  abnormalities, and even more neoplasms especially when they are recurrent and migratory.

TI  - Elevated IgG titers to periodontal pathogens related to Buerger disease.
PG  - 79-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontal pathogens were frequently detected in the occluded arteries of Buerger disease patients, hence we hypothesized that the infection from periodontal pathogens may be associated with Buerger disease. METHODS: We investigated periodontal status using various clinical parameters and serum IgG antibody levels against T. denticola, P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. intermedia in nineteen Buerger disease patients and fifteen control subjects.  The results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of periodontitis and the percentages of probing sites with PD> or =4 mm and CAL> or =4 mm were significantly higher in the patient group (P<0.001, P=0.016, and P<0.001, respectively). Patients had significantly higher serum IgG titers against T. denticola, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans (P=0.002, P=0.039, and P=0.011, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for possible implications of periodontitis in Buerger disease.

TI  - Reappraisal of thromboangiitis obliterans--a pathological contribution.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), the Winiwarter-Buerger disease, is a vasoocclusive disease of unknown etiology which typically affects medium-sized extremital vessels of young male smokers. While the diagnosis of TAO is largely based on patients' presentation and clinical criteria, pathological substrates have been poorly defined and repeatedly disputed. Comparing the histology and immunohistochemistry of TAO especially with those of arteriosclerosis obliterans  (ASO) and thromboembolism in two larger studies, we recently identified several features with significant meaning for the differential diagnosis. The unique tissue appearance of TAO is in favor of a general disorder of minute vessels indicating periarteritis rather than pure endarteritis, whereas an inflammatory reaction directed to the internal elastic lamina corresponds with the severity of disease. Since TAO or its syndromic equivalent is probably more common than currently diagnosed, the presented pathological criteria may help to identify latent cases, the overlap with ASO, and untypical organ involvement of TAO.

TI  - [Correlation of expressions of ER and CD59 in Buerger disease].
PG  - 427-9, 483
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To inquire into the expression conditions of ER, CD59 and IgG in Buerger disease arteria vessels and probe their correlation. METHODS: Two groups  of arteria vascular endothelial cells were investigated. The cells in Buerger group were derived from 30 male Buerger disease patients; the cells in the other  group were derived from 30 normal men. The levels of ER, CD59 and IgG expression  were detected by immunohistochemistry staining. RESULTS: The levels of ER and CD59 expression in Buerger disease group were higher than those of control group  (P<0.05); the level of IgG expression on arteria intima in Buerger group was lower than that of control group (P<0.05); the level of IgG expression under arteria intima in Buerger group was higher than that of control group (P<0.05). Spearman rank correlation analysis of the Buerger group showed that ZD59 expression and IgG expression are significantly correlated and ER expression and  IgG expression are significantly correlated, too. CONCLUSION: The expressions of  CD59 and ER are up-regulated, which are probably

TI  - [Sub acute ischemia of a lower limb in a patient with juvenile peripheral arterial disease and arterial cocaine toxicity].
PG  - 76-8
AB  - A 35-year-old woman was hospitalized for subacute ischemia of the left leg following an intermittent claudication for some weeks. She also presented paleness and coldness of both hands. The radial pulses could not be palpated. Smoking was the only cardiovascular risk factor. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography revealed a left popliteal thrombus combined with low diameter leg arteries and in the upper limbs stenosis of the left radial artery and thrombosis of the right radial artery. Search for a metabolic, embolic or thrombophilic etiology was negative. More minute history taking revealed use of cannabis and recent nasal administration of cocaine. Her condition improved with heparin therapy except for the upper limbs with ischemia of the hands and disabling Raynaud's phenomenon. This report highlights the combined arterial toxicity of drugs often used together by drug addicts. The association of cannabis use and tobacco smoking is not rare in patients with Buerger-like juvenile arteriopathy and cocaine may provoke peripheral vascular disease by embolism or in situ thrombosis. Interrogation of a patient presenting with Buerger-like peripheral arterial disease should insist on detecting use of drugs in association with tobacco smoking.

TI  - Current pathological and clinical aspects of Buerger's disease in Japan.
PG  - 148-56
AB  - Since Buerger's disease was first described by Leo Buerger in 1908, many authors  have discussed whether it indeed exists and, if so, is a definite clinical entity. Today, Buerger's disease is accepted as a definite vascular disease with  a typical clinical picture, natural history, and histopathology; however, the diagnosis of Buerger's disease has been controversial, and the etiology of this vascular occlusive disease has remained unknown because many authors in different countries have their own criteria. Besides, patients with this disease have decreased in number even in Japan, while there has been no change in the number of arteriosclerosis obliterans patients. Currently, only one or two new patients  per year are encountered at our outpatient clinic. The purpose of this review is  to examine the current epidemiological, pathological, and clinical aspects of Buerger's disease in Japan based on the 222 patient files of our department between 1980 and 2000 and to discuss the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and various treatment modalities.

TI  - Oral bacteria in the occluded arteries of patients with Buerger disease.
PG  - 107-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have suggested that infectious organisms play a role in vascular diseases. In this study, to explore a possible link between oral infection and Buerger disease, we investigated whether oral (periodontal) bacteria were present in occluded arteries removed from patients with characteristic Buerger disease. METHODS: Fourteen male patients with a smoking history who had developed characteristics of Buerger disease before the age of 50 years were included in this study. Occluded arteries, including superficial femoral (n = 4), popliteal (n = 2), anterior tibial (n = 4), and posterior tibial (n = 4) arteries, were removed and studied. A periodontist performed a periodontal examination on each patient and collected dental plaque and saliva samples from them at the same time. The polymerase chain reaction method was applied to detect whether seven species of periodontal bacteria--Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter rectus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia , and Prevotella nigrescens--were present in the occluded arteries and oral samples. In addition,  arterial specimens from seven control patients were examined by polymerase chain  reaction analysis. RESULTS: DNA of oral bacteria was detected in 13 of 14 arterial samples and all oral samples of patients with Buerger disease. Treponema denticola was found in 12 arterial and all oral samples. Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythensis, and Prevotella nigrescens were found in 14% to 43% of the arterial samples and 71% to 100% of the oral samples. A pathologic examination revealed that arterial specimens showed the characteristics of an intermediate-chronic-stage or chronic-stage lesion of Buerger disease. All 14 patients with Buerger disease had moderate to severe periodontitis. None of the control arterial samples was positive for periodontal bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to identify oral microorganisms in the lesions of Buerger disease. Our findings suggest a possible etiologic link between Buerger disease and chronic infections  such as oral bacterial infections.

TI  - Antibodies against human muscle enolase recognize a 45-kDa bacterial cell wall outer membrane enolase-like protein.
PG  - 53-62
AB  - Enolase, is a glycolytic enzyme ubiquitous in higher organisms, where it forms tissue specific dimers of isoforms, also found in the cytoplasm of fermentative bacteria. The aim of this work was to identify enolase-like proteins in the cell  wall of some Gram-negative bacteria using antibodies against human beta-enolase,  an isoenzyme specific to skeletal and heart muscles. Cell wall outer membrane protein (OMP) preparations were obtained from 9 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Specific enzymatic enolase activity was detected in the supernatant fractions of cytosolic and inner membrane material, but not in purified OMP preparations. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific against human beta-enolase were prepared and purified using immobilized human beta-enolase in affinity chromatography. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting assay of purified OMP preparations, rabbit anti-enolase antibody interacted specifically with a few OMPs, of which a 45-kDa band also interacted with human sera of patients presenting Buerger disease and atherosclerosis. The most distinct interaction of human sera was observed with a 45-kDa OMP of Klebsiella pneumoniae. This protein was further isolated from K. pneumoniae cell  mass in two ways, namely preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and specific affinity chromatography using immobilized affinity-purified rabbit antibody raised against human beta-enolase. The data obtained from tandem mass spectrometry tryptic peptide analysis and sequence comparison of human and bacterial enolases using protein databases, could reveal the similarity in the epitopes between membrane enolase-like protein from Klebsiella and human beta-enolase. The results show that the protein present in all studied strains has a common epitope on human beta-enolase. These data raise the question whether such a bacterial protein might be a marker for detecting and monitoring damage to skeletal and heart muscles.

TI  - Hepatocyte growth factor as potential cardiovascular therapy.
PG  - 513-9
AB  - Hepatocyte growth factor is a mesenchyme-derived pleiotropic factor that regulates the growth, motility and morphogenesis of various types of cells, and is also a member of the angiogenic growth factors. Hepatocyte growth factor is secreted by vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, c-met, was also observed in these vascular cells. Treatment of human aortic endothelial cells with recombinant hepatocyte growth factor resulted in a significant increase in cell proliferation, accompanied by mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation. Recently, a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic diseases using angiogenic growth factors to augment collateral artery development has been proposed. As preclinical study of gene therapy using hepatocyte growth factor to  treat peripheral arterial disease, naked hepatocyte growth factor plasmid was intramuscularly injected into the ischemic hind limb of rabbits in order to evaluate its angiogenic activity. Intramuscular injection of hepatocyte growth factor plasmid once on day 10 following surgery, produced significant augmentation of collateral vessel development in the ischemic limb on day 30. In  the clinical setting, the authors further investigated the safety and efficacy of hepatocyte growth factor plasmid DNA in patients with critical limb ischemia, in  a prospective open-labeled trial. Intramuscular injection of naked plasmid DNA was performed in the ischemic limbs of six patients with critical limb ischemia with arteriosclerosis obliterans (n = 3) or Buerger disease (n = 3) graded as Fontaine III or IV. In the efficacy evaluation, a reduction of pain scale of more than 1 cm on a visual analog pain scale was observed in five out of six patients. An increase in ankle pressure index of more than 0.1 was observed in five out of  five patients. The long diameter of eight out of 11 ischemic ulcers in four patients was reduced by more than 25%. Intramuscular injection of naked hepatocyte growth factor plasmid is safe, feasible and can achieve successful improvement of ischemic limbs. Although the present data were obtained to demonstrate safety in a Phase I/early Phase II trial, the initial clinical outcome with hepatocyte growth factor gene transfer seems to indicate its usefulness as sole therapy for critical limb ischemia. Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of alternative dosing regimens of gene therapy will be required to define the efficiency of this therapy.

TI  - [A role of endothelin 1 in the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans (initital news)].
PG  - 1346-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Etiology and pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans,  an uncommon disease, but connected with high risk of leg amputation, is still unknown. Genetic predisposition and inconvenient factors of environment, especially nicotine, could initiate an immunological process, which evokes endothelial dysfunction. In histological preparation inflammation and thrombus are observed. Endo-thelin-1 could affect these processes. It is a strong vasa-constrictor and has a wide spectrum of biological activity, often opposed to effect of prostacycline analogs. The aim of study was a role of endothelin-1, antielastin antibodies and selectin P, L, E in the pathogenesis Buerger's disease and influence of alprostadil on these parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 10 patients with Buerger disease in the active phase, which were divided in two subgroups. Four persons with necrosis of toes were in the first subgroup,  and six patients with rest pain but without trophic changes in the second subgroup. 13 healthy persons composed the control group. Index of antielastin antibodies, concentration of endotehlin-1, selectin P, L and E were measured in venous and arterial serum. These parameters by patients were determined twice: before and after 10-days treatment with alprostadil 20-40 microg per day. Concentration of endothelin-1, selectins and index antielastin antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay. RESULTS: We observe increase in endothelin-1 concentration by persons with necrosis of toes compared to patients  without these changes (p=0.024) and to control (p=0.022). In the subgroup I index of antielastin antibodies IgA was higher than in control group (p=0.020). After alprostadil treatment endothelin-1 concentration, antielastin antibodies index was not statistically significant compared to results before treatment or control group. We observed correlation between concentration of endo-tehlin-1 before treatment and index of antielastin antibodies IgG (p=0.0475). We observed significant diffrance of concentration of selectin P, L and E compared to control (p=0.038). Especially we noticed higher concentration of selectin P (p=0.001) than in control group. The after treatment reduction of concentration was only for selectin L statistically significant (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: 1. Plasma endothelin-1 level play a role in the exacerbation of clinical symtpoms of thromboangiitis obliterans. 2. Endothelial injury is connected with increase in concentration of selectin P in patient's serum. 3. Alprostadil didn't influence on concentration of endothelin-1 in these patients.

TI  - Inflammatory joint disease and severe ischemia of the extremities revealing thromboangiitis obliterans in a female.
PG  - 69-72
AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (or Buerger disease) is a rare vascular disease that selectively affects young males who are inveterate smokers. We report a case in a young female smoker who presented with recurrent episodes of polyarthralgia and distal extremity ischemia. The initial diagnosis was connective tissue disease, and the correct diagnosis was established only 7 years after symptom onset. Joint manifestations are common in thromboangiitis obliterans and usually antedate the  diagnosis, which should be considered in patients with superficial venous thrombosis, upper limb ischemia, or Raynaud's phenomenon. This is true even in females, as shown by the case described here.

AB  - The diagnosis of vascularitis should be proposed when a concentric and regular thickening of the wall of the aorta or one of its branches is observed or when there is late enhancement of the arterial wall, on sites which are usually free from atheromatous lesions and in a young patient. The radiologist must be aware of the associated clinical signs: oral and genital ulcerative lesions in the Behcet syndrome; finger necrosis in a young male smoker in Buerger disease; hip and shoulder arthropathy and headache in a 70 Year old female and Horton disease; pulseless upper limbs and inflammatory syndrome in a young adult for the Takayasu arteritis. The diagnosis of popliteal entrapment or adventitial cyst should be proposed in young patients without atheromatous lesions.

TI  - Safety evaluation of clinical gene therapy using hepatocyte growth factor to treat peripheral arterial disease.
PG  - 203-9
AB  - Therapeutic angiogenesis using angiogenic growth factors is expected to be a new  treatment for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). Because hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has potent angiogenic activity, we investigated the safety and efficiency of HGF plasmid DNA in patients with CLI as a prospective open-labeled clinical trial. Intramuscular injection of naked HGF plasmid DNA was performed in ischemic limbs of 6 CLI patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (n=3) or Buerger disease (n=3) graded as Fontaine III or IV. The primary end points were safety and improvement of ischemic symptoms at 12 weeks after transfection. Severe complications and adverse effects caused by gene transfer were not detected in any patients. Of particular importance, no apparent edema was observed in any patient throughout the trial. In addition, serum HGF concentration was not changed throughout the therapy period in all patients. In contrast, a reduction of pain scale of more than 1 cm in visual analog pain scale was observed in 5 of 6 patients. Increase in ankle pressure index more than 0.1 was observed in 5 of 5 patients. The long diameter of 8 of 11 ischemic ulcers in  4 patients was reduced >25%. Intramuscular injection of naked HGF plasmid is safe, feasible, and can achieve successful improvement of ischemic limbs. Although the present data are conducted to demonstrate the safety as phase I/early phase IIa, the initial clinical outcome with HGF gene transfer seems to indicate usefulness as sole therapy for CLI.

TI  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) in a female mild smoker treated with spinal cord stimulation.
PG  - 365-8
AB  - The authors report the case of a 42-year-old female mild smoker admitted to the Hospital of Ferrara for the onset of asymptomatic necrotic ulcerations localized  to the second, third, and fourth toes of left foot. Physical examination showed asphygmia of inferior limb distal peripheral pulses, with localized extremity marbleized and cyanotic skin at the level of the left foot, where necrotic ulcers were present at the second, third, and fourth toes. Doppler ultrasonography and angiography revealed a severe obliterating arteriopathy of bilateral distal arterial circulation. Both blood chemistry panel (including autoimmune and hypercoagulable profile) and diagnostic examination findings were normal. Thus, the patient met several criteria to be diagnosed with Buerger disease. After an attempt at medical therapy with the intravenous administration of the prostaglandin-analogue iloprost, given the young age and the lack of viable distal target vessels for bypass grafting, a spinal cord stimulator was implanted. More than 2 years later, the patient has a normal life.

TI  - [Conservative treatment of chronic obstructive arterial disease with iloprost and physical training: assessment of results in 5 years of a study with 360 patients].
PG  - 453-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The treatment of patients with Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (P.A.O.D.) is, until now, a therapeutics challenge. The purpose of this study was to confirm the safety of Iloprost infusion, to estimate the results after an Home Exercise Program joined to the therapy and to identify groups of patients with P.A.O.D. that can benefit from Iloprost therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 360 patients with and without diabetic with P.A.O.D. (Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease) at the stage of II, III, & IV, with Buerger Syndrome, were treated with Iloprost at the maximum dosage: 2 ng/kg/min for 6 hours a day,  for a minimum of 1 week and a maximum of 3 weeks with cycles of therapy every 3,  6 or 12 months. At the end of each cycle of therapy there was assigned an Home Exercise Program. Patients with symptoms of pain are observed in the study and monitored for how long the pain lasted or diminished. The clinical benefit was evaluated on the reduction of the pain and analgesics, on the improvement of the  trophics lesions and on the increase of gait's distance. RESULTS: After 5 years of follow up, it was reported 12.2% of major amputations and 3.6% of deads. Over  60% of the patients, that were at risk for amputation at the beginning of the study, were alive. The tolerability of therapy was been very acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: This study, at the end of 5 years, showed that the therapeutic infusion of Iloprost associated with an intensive Home Exercise Program, can, before 12 months, show patient improvement of the gait's distance from 50-200%.

TI  - Clinical and social consequences of Buerger disease.
PG  - 176-80
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess the clinical course of Buerger disease and to analyze the social problems that influence quality of life of affected patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ten patients with Buerger disease (106 men, 4 women; mean age, 40.0 years) for whom complete data since onset of disease were available were included in this retrospective study (mean follow-up, 10.6 years). Data were obtained by means of direct interview, written  reports, or telephone. Data for deceased subjects were gathered from their families via written report or telephone. Graft patency was evaluated by means of ankle pressure measurement; and in all patients with decreased ankle pressure arteriography was performed. RESULTS: Seven of 110 study patients (6%) died during follow-up. Cumulative survival rate was 84% up to 25 years after the initial consultation. Results of bypass operations (n = 46) were not satisfactory. Primary graft patency was 41% at 1 year after operation, 32% at 5 years, and 30% at 10 years. Secondary graft patency was 54% at 1 year of follow-up, 47% at 5 years, and 39% at 10 years. However, major amputation was necessary in only 5 of 35 limbs (14%) with failed grafts. Forty-seven patients (43%) underwent 108 amputation procedures, either major amputation (13 patients)  or minor amputation (34 patients), of an upper or lower limb. No ischemic ulcers  occurred or recurred in patients older than 60 years. Forty-one patients who stopped smoking did not undergo major amputation. Furthermore, of 69 patients who continued smoking, 13 patients (19%) underwent major amputation. There was a correlation between incidence of continued smoking and limb amputation (P =.0070). In addition, 11 of 13 patients who underwent major lower limb amputation (85%) lost their job, compared with 9 of 97 patients without major amputation (9%). There was an association between limb amputation and job loss (P <.0001). All patients who lost their jobs were engaged in manual labor. CONCLUSION: The natural course of life and limb is favorable in many patients with Buerger disease. Occurrence or recurrence of necrotic lesions usually is arrested in patients older than 60 years. To avoid factors that markedly influence quality of life, early treatment and strict instruction to prohibit smoking are mandatory. Arterial reconstruction shortens the healing process of ischemic ulcers, despite  poor long-term results. However, bypass surgery to treat intermittent claudication should be limited.

TI  - Numerically stable algorithms for the computation of reduced unit cells.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - The computation of reduced unit cells is an important building block for a number of crystallographic applications, but unfortunately it is very easy to demonstrate that the conventional implementation of cell reduction algorithms is  not numerically stable. A numerically stable implementation of the Niggli-reduction algorithm of Krivy & Gruber [Acta Cryst. (1976), A32, 297-298] is presented. The stability is achieved by consistently using a tolerance in all  floating-point comparisons. The tolerance must be greater than the accumulated rounding errors. A second stable algorithm is also presented, the minimum reduction, that does not require using a tolerance. It produces a cell with minimum lengths and all angles acute or obtuse. The algorithm is a simplified and modified version of the Buerger-reduction algorithm of Gruber [Acta Cryst. (1973), A29, 433-440]. Both algorithms have been enhanced to generate a change-of-basis matrix along with the parameters of the reduced cell.

TI  - Ischemic intestinal involvement in a patient with Buerger disease: case report and literature review.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - A 42-year-old Japanese man who had undergone amputation of the left leg below the knee because of Buerger disease required emergency thrombectomy 7 months later. He complained of acute abdominal pain after thrombectomy. At aortography the distal superior mesenteric artery and its branches were not well visualized. Emergency laparotomy was performed because of suspected intestinal ischemia, and  the terminal ileum and cecum and part of the ascending colon were resected. In total, the patient underwent laparotomy four times. Histopathologic findings revealed that the arteries and veins of the resected small intestine were occluded with organized thrombi. Inflammatory cell infiltration was recognized mainly in the intima. These findings are compatible with Buerger disease.

TI  - [Experiences with endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy].
PG  - 621-4
AB  - PATIENTS AND METHOD: Thoracic sympathectomy using thoracoscopy was performed in 38 cases on 35 patients from January 01. 1996, till December 31. 2000. In 3 cases bilateral sympathectomy was carried out. The youngest patient was 18, the oldest  was 76 years old, the average age was 42 years. The indications for surgery were  Raynaud syndrome, causalgia, post-traumatic sympathetic dystrophy, thoracic outlet syndrome combined with vasospastic syndrome, Buerger syndrome, obliteration of digital arteries, embolism and hyperhidrosis. This method was chosen if conservative therapy was unsuccessful. Laparoscopic instruments are particularly suitable for minimal invasive interventions. RESULTS: Authors describe their operative technique whereby the postoperative pain and also the duration of hospitalisation can be reduced, and the cosmetic result can be improved. In two cases conversion was the only choice due to pleural adhesions. Pneumothorax occurred in two cases, haemothorax in one case and transient intercostal neuralgy was seen in 3 cases. In four cases sympathetic activity returned during the follow up. Ceasing the sympathetic innervation dilates the arterioles of the skin, and the temperature of the skin increases. During follow-up the complaints of the patients improved significantly, the progression  became slower and clear improvement was found with instrumental investigations. CONCLUSION: This method can be recommended to every institute where the conditions for traditional laparoscopic surgery are given and staff is experienced in thoracotomy.

TI  - Distinct amplification of an untranslated regulatory sequence in the egfr gene contributes to early steps in breast cancer development.
PG  - 1172-8
AB  - Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) gene is a common feature in breast cancer. We demonstrated recently that the expression of EGFR in breast cancer strongly correlates with the length of a CA simple sequence repeat  within the first 2000 bases in intron 1 of the egfr gene [CA simple sequence repeat (CA-SSR) I; H. Buerger et al., Cancer Res., 60: 854-857, 2000]. Using a standardized semiautomated method of microsatellite analysis for loss of heterozygosity detection, we identified an allelic imbalance (AI) at the egfr locus in 55 of 163 primary breast cancer cases. Fine mapping of the chromosomal region at 7p12-15 around the egfr gene using 10 CA-SSR markers showed that mutations of egfr in breast cancer are frequently restricted to the first intron  of egfr. Thereby, the simple sequence repeat CA-SSR I in intron 1 was affected in 84% of the patients with AI. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of 23 breast cancer tissues with AI excluded the presence of in-frame deletions between exon 2 and exon 7. For additional characterization of the underlying phenomenon leading  to the detection of an AI in microsatellite analysis, a quantitative 5'-nuclease  assay for the first CA-SSR I in intron 1 was established. In breast cancer cases  with AI the presence of amplifications of this sequence was shown. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a statistically significant worse prognosis for patients with AI in the cancer tissue at the egfr locus compared with patients without AI. Interestingly, 75% of the patients bearing AI of CA-SSR I in the tumor also showed AI at normal, nontumorous breast tissue. Our data strongly support the assumption that distinct amplifications in intronic sequences of the egfr gene, which enhance the basic transcription activity of the gene, represent one of the  first steps in breast carcinogenesis. Furthermore, they point to the presence of  prognosis-associated markers for breast cancer already in morphological normal breast tissue.

TI  - [Myocardial infarction simultaneous with Buerger disease (obliterating thromboangiitis). A case report].
PG  - 306-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few cases of Buerger's disease concurring with visceral disorders, i.e., cardiac disease characterized by coronary obstruction have been published.  We report the case of a 56 years old patient, with Buerger's disease concurring with ischemic heart disease: extensive anterior myocardial infarction, thrombosis, and obstruction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, evidenced through coronariography. DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE: Male patient, 56 years old, severe smoker since the age of 15, obese, normal blood pressure, carrier of Buerger's disease for 15 years, without symptoms or signs of rheumatic disorders, and negative immunological tests, with antecedents of an old extensive myocardial infarction secondary to diffuse disease of the left anterior descending artery. At present, with symptoms and signs of ischemic cardiopathy and angiographic images suggesting the presence of thrombi inside the anterior descending coronary artery, of gracile aspect (corkscrew image), severe and diffusely obstructed (80%), and poor distal vascular bed. DISCUSSION: Causal association between Buerger's disease and coronary disease is rare and difficult  to demonstrate in the absence of immunological and histopathological tests. Data  provided by coronariography do not evidence a common origin for both diseases. However, the angiographic image of the gracile coronary artery, corkscrew-shaped, and with intraluminal thrombi suggests dissemination of the thromboangiitis to the coronary arterial bed. CONCLUSION: The concurrence of Buerger's disease with  coronary pathology is rare. Coronary dissemination is difficult to demonstrate with only coronariography data; however, there are data in the medical literature suggesting that coronary obstruction, in these cases, results from the dissemination of the vasculopathy.

TI  - [Review of current etiopathogenic data of Buerger disease].
PG  - 263-5
AB  - Although 75 years have passed since Buerger's disease was described as a separate nosological, its etiology and pathogenesis are not sufficiently elucidated. According to many authors the disease origin is significantly connected to genetic and environmental factors. Exposure of some patients with special genotype, mainly HLA-A9 and HLA-B5, to environmental factors, mainly nicotine, may be the base of etiology and pathogenesis of Buerger's disease. Discovery of antielastin, anticollagen I and III antibodies, antinicotine and antivascular antigen antibodies in blood of patients, allowed to put forward a theory of immunological character of TO. In Buerger's disease, defined in recent years as an inactive collagenosis, immunological complexes, cell toxins developing during  phagocytosis, found in smokers, constitute the main agents responsible for vascular wall damage. Disturbance of prostacyclin I2/thromboxane A2 balance and accelerated platelet aggregation cause spasm of arterioles and in effect lead to  higher procoagulant readiness. Some adhesive molecules, for example P and L selectins, play an important role in vascular endothelium damage. Prostaglandin treatment induces an improvement of vascular wall (endothelium) status, and simultaneously improvement of tissue perfusion, expressed by a decrease of selectin and vWF concentrations and of the number of desquamated endothelial cells.

TI  - Plasma catecholamines in Buerger's disease: effects of cigarette smoking and surgical sympathectomy.
PG  - 338-43
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to study the influence of tobacco exposure and sympathectomy on basal sympathoadrenal function of patients with Buerger's disease. DESIGN: plasma catecholamines were measured before and after smoking, in patients with Buerger's disease (n=13), in patients with Buerger's disease submitted to surgical bilateral lumbar sympathectomy (n=13), and in healthy volunteers (n=16). MATERIALS AND METHODS: venous blood samples were collected before and 2h after smoking one cigarette (0.9mg nicotine). Plasma concentrations (pg/ml) of dihydroxiphenylalanine (pL-DOPA), noradrenalin (pNA), adrenalin (pAD) and 3,4-dihydroxiphenylacetic acid (pDOPAC) were determined. RESULTS: Buerger's patients have low basal plasma catecholamines compared to volunteers: pNA (501 (196-927) vs 1858 (968-3663)) and pAD (71 (31-109) vs 193 (116-334)). Sympathectomy increased pL-DOPA, pAD and pDOPAC, but not pNA. After smoking, pNA  only decreased in volunteers (1858 (968-3663) vs 1064 (535-2393)). In Buerger+sympathectomy group, smoking lowered pAD (700 (58-3379) vs 278 (54-429)). CONCLUSIONS: in Buerger's disease there is an impairment of sympathoadrenal function with an altered peripheral adrenergic response to cigarette smoking. Patients submitted to sympathectomy have high pAD, but this benefit is reversed after smoking. This might be clinically relevant given the association between cigarette smoking and the manifestations of Buerger's disease and the controversy on the effectiveness of sympathectomy in the management of the disease.

TI  - [The latest review of therapeutic angiogenesis using angiogenic growth factors to peripheral arterial diseases].
PG  - 1845-55
AB  - Therapeutic angiogenesis using angiogenic growth factors is expected to be a new  treatment of patients with severe ischemic diseases. Indeed, human gene therapy for peripheral arterial disease(PAD) using VEGF gene demonstrated the beneficial  effects. In contrast, we have reported the potent angiogenic activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in animal study and we planned gene therapy for ASO and Buerger disease using HGF gene (TREAT-HGF). In a prospective, open-labeled clinical trial, we investigated the safety and biological efficiency of this gene therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease(PAD) who had failed conventional therapy.

TI  - Humic acid extracted from Blackfoot disease-endemic well water induces adipocyte  differentiation of C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells: a possible mechanism leading to atherosclerotic-like plaque in Blackfoot disease.
PG  - 48-54
AB  - A unique peripheral vascular disease named "Blackfoot disease" (BFD) is endemic on the southwest coast of Taiwan. Clinically, the signs and symptoms of BFD are similar to those of arteriosclerosis and Buerger disease. Humic acid has been proposed as a causative factor in BFD; however, the relationship between humic acid and atherosclerotic-like plaque associated with BFD remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of humic acid extracted from Blackfoot disease-endemic well water (BFD-HA) on cultured C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, a murine embryonic cell line. Our present data demonstrate that C3H10T1/2 cells were arrested at the G1 phase and subsequently differentiated to adipocytes after treatment with BFD-HA. The adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells induced by BFD-HA was also accompanied with increased glycosaminoglycan production. These results suggest that a large lipid accumulation of arterial blood vessels in BFD  patients may be linked in part to the adipocyte differentiation of vascular fibroblasts induced by BFD-HA.

AB  - The causal effect of cannabis, associated or not with smoking, in juvenile thromboangiitis disorders such as Leo Buerger disease, has been suggested. We describe here a case of a 30-year-old woman who smoked cannabis and developed intermittent claudication of the lower limbs. Female sex and proximal localization of the lesions (external iliac artery) are not usually described in  "cannabis arteritis". Cannabis would be involved not only in the pathogenesis of  juvenile obstructive arteriopathy, but also in the development of atheromatous lesions in the young subject.

AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) is a rare vascular disease, characterized by a multilocular, segmental, non-arteriosclerotic, thrombotic inflammation of small and medium size arterial and venous vessels and nerves. The precise etiology is unknown, but there is a cause-effect relationship with tobacco smoking. Autoimmunological, immunogenetic, infectious and hemostatic processes have been discussed as pathogenetic factors. The clinical picture is typically characterized by acrally localized, non-healing ulcerations, which frequently prompt patients to see a dermatologist. We present two patients with thromboangiitis obliterans and discuss the clinical features, the resulting differential diagnostic spectrum and possible therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Thromboangiitis obliterans: an old disease in need of a new look.
PG  - S167-70; discussion S171-3
AB  - Almost a century after Buerger's original description of thromboangiitis obliterans, there is still no consensus about diagnostic criteria. The lack of a  universally accepted method of diagnosis causes confusion, and mars research efforts. Some authors quote 'hematological disease' as one of the exclusion criteria. But in most recent reports, suspected Buerger patients did not undergo  hematological tests to diagnose or rule out any primary or secondary hypercoagulable states. However, immunogenetic studies of Buerger's disease have  led to a revived interest in the role of blood coagulation in the pathogenesis of thromboangiitis obliterans. Some association has been suggested between Buerger's disease and the antiphospholipid syndrome, as well as hyperhomocysteinemia. Other thrombophilic conditions have been described anecdotally in patients with Buerger's disease. In view of this developing line of investigation, there is a clear need to redefine the diagnostic algorithm and the criteria for diagnosing Buerger's disease.

TI  - Cocaine and Buerger disease: is there a pathogenetic association?
PG  - 2057-60
AB  - A patient with a diagnosis of Buerger disease is described with peripheral limb ischemia and toe amputations, 2 recent small myocardial infarctions, and a long history of cigarette use. Peripheral angiography findings were incompatible with  the clinical impression, and further workup revealed heavy recreational use of cocaine. A literature review of the clinical and pathologic manifestations of Buerger disease and of cocaine exposure shows them to have remarkable similarities. Based on our case observation and suggestive evidence from the literature, we propose that cocaine exposure may masquerade as Buerger disease, and further, that unrecognized cocaine exposure may underlie such cases, even including those originally described by Buerger in 1908.

TI  - Thromboangiitis obliterans: classic and new morphological features.
PG  - 59-67
AB  - The clinical and pathological concept of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO, Buerger's disease) is still controversial. While the clinical criteria of TAO are relatively well defined, the etiology is unknown and its diagnosis based on pathology is confusing, since there is no consensus on the precise pathological criteria for TAO. To investigate the morphological features that differentiate TAO from arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) or thromboembolism, and to clarify the morphological independence of TAO, we studied 94 amputated specimens of lower extremities, including 31 specimens from patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAO and 31 autopsy specimens as control cases. It was revealed that most of the classic morphological features described by Buerger and others are not helpful when considered independently in the differential diagnosis, except for intact internal elastic lamina. In addition, findings of intimal inflammation, intact media and absence of medial calcification were demonstrated to be common in both  TAO and thromboembolism. Statistical analysis in the present study, the most comprehensive thus far, showed that novel findings of onion-like-shaped recanalizing vessels in the occluded arteries, adventitial fibrosis without medial fibrosis, swelling of the endothelium of the vasa vasorum and edema beneath the external elastic lamina were characteristic of TAO and would be helpful in a differential diagnosis. When a combination of these morphological features is present, diagnosis of a presumed overlap of TAO and ASO in the same site of the vessel concerned is possible. Furthermore, comparison of statistical  evaluations based on morphological features performed in various diagnostic groups implies that the clinical diagnosis of TAO is currently underestimated because the results of the analysis of morphological features of specimens in which TAO was suspected or specimens selected on the basis of a broad and nonspecific definition of TAO were surprisingly similar to the results in strictly defined TAO cases. Our findings suggest that injury and regeneration of  minute vessels such as recanalizing vessels and vasa vasorum play a part in the pathogenesis of TAO.

TI  - [Angiography detection of closed palmar arcs].
PG  - 207-10
AB  - PURPOSE: Angiographic evaluation of the prevalence of an anastomosis between the  superficial and deep palmer arcs in our patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between  January 1st 1991 and December 31st 1997, all selectively performed angiographies  of the upper extremities were evaluated retrospectively with special focus on an  anastomosis between the superficial palmer arc (SPA) and the deep palmer arc (DPA). The indications for performing a selective angiography of the upper extremity were presurgical planning of a skin/muscle transplantation (n = 42), creation of a hemodialysis fistula (n = 4) and evaluation of vascular diseases such as vasculitis (n = 9), peripheral occlusive disease (n = 3) and M. Winiwarter-Buerger (n = 8). RESULTS: 66 selective angiographies of the palm of 60 patients (39 male, 21 female, mean age 52 years old) could be used for evaluation. Angiographies of both hands were performed in 6 patients. Closed superficial palmar arcs and closed deep palmar arcs were detected in 31.8% and 84.8% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of anastomosed superficial and deep palmar arcs in our study are comparable with those of former angiographic investigations, but they are considerably lower than the rates based on anatomical or sonographical studies. Reasons for the discrepancy are discussed.

TI  - 90 years of Buerger's disease--what has changed?
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans or Winiwarter-Buerger's disease is a primary systemic  vasculitis of an unknown etiology, which affects medium-sized arteries and veins  mainly in the lower and upper extremities, causing multiple segmental arterial occlusions especially in young male smokers. The aim of our study is to compare the knowledge on the etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in the time of Leo Buerger (90 years ago) and now.  Between 1994 and 1998, 26 patients (19 men and 7 women) were investigated with clinical suspicion for Winiwarter-Buerger's disease. Laboratory and arteriographic investigation revealed typical signs for this disease in 22 of them. To the most common clinical signs or symptoms belong smoking and the onset  of the disease before the age of 50 years (in 95.5%), intermittent claudication (in 72.7%), rest pain and ischaemic ulcers or gangrenes in the fingers (in 68.2%). In slightly more than half of the patients migrating superficial thrombophlebitis was present and similarly in one half of the patients Raynaud's  phenomenon was found. In conclusion--What has changed from the times of Leo Buerger? 1. Prevalence of TAO increased in women. 2. Older patients (more than 40 years old) are being diagnosed. 3. Upperextremity involvement is more frequently  present. 4. Diagnosis of TAO is being more proper, especially due to up-to-date diagnostic methods, like digital subtraction angiography. 5. The treatment is more effective, amputation number is decreased. And what has not changed? Similarly like Leo Buerger we do not known the precise etiology of the disease. Ceasation of smoking has still the most important therapeutic procedure. The clinical course of the disease is individual and in spite of the treatment is the clinical course unpredictable.

TI  - [The role of drug therapy in the treatment of critical ischemia of the lower limbs].
PG  - 647-50
AB  - A SERIOUS CONDITION: Critical ischemia results when severe chronic ischemia worsens, creating a threatening situation for tissue survival in the lower limbs. The degree of ischemia is related to the extent of impairment in microcirculation, adding further deleterious effects to stenoses and/or obstructions of the large vessels. MANAGEMENT DIFFICULTIES: Surgery is the mainstay therapy for critical ischemia of the lower limbs. Medical therapy is indicated as first intention treatment in only 10 to 15% of the patients and in a small proportion after partial or total surgical failure when immediate secondary amputation appears to be avoidable. TREATMENTS USED: Antithrombosis agents and drugs with a hemorrheologic effect are used in case of surgical failure or non-indication for surgery. Iloprost is one of the most extensively studied hemorrheology agents. Its use improves the chances of avoiding amputation within  a mid-term delay. BUERGER DISEASE: Buerger disease is a specific condition different from the two other major causes (artherothrombosis and diabetes mellitus). The therapeutic management and functional prognosis are much different.

TI  - [Cannabis-induced arteritis vs. Leo Buerger disease. Nosologic discussion apropos of two new cases].
PG  - 71-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: We observed two cases of juvenile endarteritis which might suggest a  possible link between Winiwarter-Buerger disease and cannabis-induced endarteritis. CASE REPORTS: Our two patients were young men aged 18 and 20 years. Both developed acute distal ischemia of the lower or upper limbs with arteriographic evidence suggestive of Winiwarter-Buerger disease. Both smoked regularly but not excessively and both used cannabis regularly. In one case, the  therapeutic response to withdrawal of cannabis was good. In the second, use of cannabis continued and arterial disease persisted. DISCUSSION: The cause of Winiwarter-Buerger disease remains elusive although smoking is undoubtedly involved in the pathogenic mechanism. Our two cases recall the cannabis-induced endarteritis described in the sixties in Kif smokers in North Africa. The main clinical and radiographical features in this condition are the same as in Winiwarter-Buerger disease. CONCLUSION: Winiwarter-Buerger disease and cannabis-induced endarteritis are 2 very similar conditions. The probably rare finding of juvenile endarteritis mimicking thromboangeitis obliterans should, in  our opinion, be considered as a secondary and possibly toxic effect of cannabis.

TI  - The change in concept and surgical treatment on Buerger's disease--personal experience and review.
PG  - S273-80; discussion S281
AB  - Buerger's disease was originally described by Leo Buerger in 1908 as thromboangitis obliterance and has been considered as one of the most intractable vasculitis syndromes in our country. This lesion is popularly seen in male young  generation with a background history of heavy smoking. Buerger's disease in Japan has been frequently seen in our practice; however, it is noted that there have been certain definitive changes in relation to number of patients, clinical manifestation as well as course of treatment in particular in surgical treatment. Firstly, the number of patients who visited at outpatient clinic as well as to admit hospital has been sharply declined. Secondly, the number of surgical treatments of Buerger's disease have also decreased. The sympathectomy, mainly lumbal sympathectomy, which was maintained at about 15 to 20% of the number of patients admitted, was virtually abolished from the practice and mainly converted to the medical and pharmacological treatment by prostaglandin. The reliability of pharmacological sympathectomy is one of the other reasons which contributed to the shift of treatment. It is also our impression that the severity of the disease itself has been changed, in other words, we do not frequently see very severely ill patients. As far as surgery is concerned the important modality in the treatment for the advanced lesion of Buerger's disease is mainly confined in  small arteries with multisegmental occlusion. As a consequence, the surgical reconstructive procedures are technically difficult and long term patency rate is considered to be low. As far as our experience is concerned, it is noted that the number of bypass surgery was most frequently seen at below trifurcation segment of knee joint; in other words, peripheral, distal type bypass was the most popular, followed by above knee segment. The reconstructive surgery at femoral region was least frequently seen. On the other hand, the patency rate of bypass graft was higher in the proximal segment in comparison to the distal segment. Although the number of arterial reconstructive procedures has been definitively declined, as was seen in sympathectomy surgery. It is difficult to predict accurately what kind of factors are affecting or contributing to the change in concept in Buerger's disease as well as the course of treatment, it is suggested  that the environmental factors may playing a major role for the modification of disease process.

TI  - Pathology and pathogenesis of Buerger's disease.
PG  - S237-42
AB  - Since Buerger's disease, which is also called 'thromboangiitis obliterans', was proposed in 1908 (Buerger, Am J Med Soc 1908;136:567), more cases have been reported from the United States, Europe, and especially from the Orient. However  the pathogenesis of this disease remains unclarified, and its acceptance as a specific disease entity has been disputed (Gore and Burrows, Am J Clin Pathol 1958;29:319; Wessler et al., N Engl J Med 1960;262:1149). We histologically examined the surgically resected arterial specimens from 113 cases, 109 males and four females, clinically diagnosed as Buerger's disease in 1975-1976 and reported the results in 1978 (Kurozumi and Tanaka, Vasc Surg 1978;12:63) and proposed that the term 'Buerger's disease' should be replaced by 'Buerger's syndrome'. We reexamined the above-mentioned cases and will report the pathology and propose the possible pathogenesis of Buerger's disease.

TI  - Takayasu arteritis, Buerger disease and inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms:  is there a common pathway in their pathogenesis?
PG  - S5-10
AB  - Takayasu arteritis, Bueger disease and IAAA are non-specific vasculitis involving mainly large vessels, the etiology of which are all still in the mist. Our recent HLA analysis on Takayasu arteritis and Buerger disease revealed a close association with some HLA antigens which made us suppose the common pathological  pathway to cause these morbid conditions. International survey on Takayasu arteritis also revealed cases involving abdominal aorta only (Type IV, International Classification) in Asian countries, very similar to clinical and pathological features of IAAA. These ongoing survey suggest the common mechanism  in the pathophysiology of these morbid conditions.

TI  - Physical examination and chronic lower-extremity ischemia: a critical review.
PG  - 1357-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical utility of physical examination in patients  with suspected chronic ischemia of the lower extremities. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search (January 1966 to January 1997), personal files, and bibliographies of textbooks on physical diagnosis, surgery, and vascular surgery. STUDY SELECTION:  Both authors independently graded the studies as level 1, 2, or 3, according to predetermined criteria. Criteria deemed essential for analysis of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were (1) clear definition of study population, (2) clear definition of physical examination maneuver, and (3) use of an acceptable criterion standard test for comparison. RESULTS: The following positive findings help clinicians diagnose the presence of peripheral arterial disease: abnormal pedal pulses, a unilaterally cool extremity, a prolonged venous filling time, and a femoral bruit. Other physical signs help determine the extent and distribution of vascular disease, including an abnormal femoral pulse, lower-extremity bruits, warm knees, and the Buerger test. The capillary refill test and the findings of foot discoloration, atrophic skin, and hairless extremities are unhelpful in diagnostic decisions. Mathematical formulas, derived from 2 studies using multivariate analysis, allow clinicians to estimate the probability of peripheral arterial disease in their patients. CONCLUSION: Certain aspects of the physical examination help clinicians make accurate judgments about the presence of peripheral arterial disease and its distribution.

TI  - [Surgical technique of endoscopic transthoracic sympathicotomy: axillary approach].
PG  - 206-9
AB  - A total of 181 endoscopic transthoracic sympathicotomy were performed at our hospital from December, 1992 to March, 1997. After single-lumen endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia, the patient was placed in half sitting position. A small (1 cm) incision was made in the anterior axillary line through  the third intercostal space and an apical pneumothorax was created by insufflation of 1.8 L of CO2 in the pleural cavity through a Surgineedle. A 24 Fr. urological transurethral electroresectoscope was introduced through the same  incision. The sympathetic chain could be observed through parietal pleura riding  on the costovertebral junctions. In palmar hyperhidrosis the second and third thoracic sympathetic ganglia were electrocoagulated. In axillary hyperhidrosis the forth ganglion was included. The lung was expanded by limiting expiration and sucking CO2. The operation was repeated on the other side. Endoscopic transthoracic sympathicotomy was an efficient, safe and low invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of palmar, axillary hyperhidrosis, Raynaud's disease  and Buerger disease.

PG  - 1945-8
AB  - Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) or Buerger's disease is an inflammatory disease  that affects the small and medium caliber arteries and veins. It affects predominantly young, smoking males. The clinical manifestations are usually ischemic lesions of the extremities or limb claudication. The physiopathology is  yet unknown. However, several hypotheses involving a dysregulation of the immune  response are discussed. Here, we report a case of a young woman, smoker, that presented with diffuse arthralgia of the lower extremities. We were able to diagnose a thromboangiitis obliterans using criteria established by Papa et al. They include anamnestic, clinical and angiographic data. The pharmacological treatment of TAO is disappointing. The only way to prevent the extension of the disease is to stop smoking cigarettes.

TI  - Angiographic findings in Buerger disease.
PG  - S189-95
AB  - To clarify the angiographic findings in patients with Buerger disease and to elucidate the relationship between the angiographic findings and the clinical prognosis, 144 angiographic images of the lower extremities of 119 patients with  Buerger disease have been studied. The present study has included patient data in our previous report. Results of this study revealed that in lower extremities showing a femoropopliteal arterial occlusion (n = 57), the frequency of gangrene  was significantly lower statistically in limbs in which the main arteries of the  lower leg and foot were well visualized (2 (12%) of 17 limbs) than in limbs in which the main arteries did not visualize (25 (63%) of 40 limbs) (P < 0.001). Further, in lower extremities showing a crural arterial occlusion (n = 59), the incidence of pedal gangrene increased as the extent of pedal arterial occlusion increased, though this rise was not statistically significant. Also, the collateral vessels had a 'corkscrew' appearance in 39 (27%) of 144 limbs affected by Buerger disease, whereas this appearance was seen in only 2 (3%) of 63 limbs of patients with arteriosclerosis obliterans (P < 0.001). Another finding of this study is that corkscrew-shaped vessels that extend from the sites of the arterial occlusion to the periphery of the feet without opacification of the main pedal arteries indicate a poor prognosis. Based on the above findings, we thus believe  that the appearance of corkscrew-shaped vessels is the most characteristic feature of Buerger disease and that each represents a dilated vasa vasorum of the occluded main arteries.

AB  - Buerger disease is an chronic vasculitis mainly involving lower extremities. This disease is sometimes contrasted with Takayasu arteritis because both are speculated autoimmune mechanisms as an important factor in their etiology. Furthermore both are frequently encountered in Asian countries. However, patients with Takayasu arteritis were mostly young women in Japan and, on the contrary, patients with Buerger disease were mainly middle aged men. Recent HLA studies on  Buerger disease are revealing the interesting results in comparison with those on Takayasu arteritis. The outline of Buerger disease will be described herein.

TI  - Transcranial Doppler velocities in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans.
PG  - 535-44
AB  - The idea of cerebrovascular injury in cases of thromboangiitis obliterans was not strange to Leo Buerger, but Jager (1932), as well Lindenberg and Spatz (1939), first established it. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemodynamics in the basal cerebral arteries by means of transcranial Doppler in patients with  thromboangiitis obliterans. Thirty patients (all men; average age 40.03 +/- 16.4  years) were included--one group twenty-four to forty years of age and another group forty-one to fifty years of age. The results show that the blood flow velocities in middle and anterior cerebral arteries in both groups of patients were significantly lower than in healthy persons. The trends towards reduction of blood flow velocity were also evident in posterior cerebral arteries. The authors describe in detail 2 patients who suffered major ischemic stroke. Cerebrovascular disorders in Buerger's disease are probably more frequent than supposed and have  to be taken into account.

In order to limit the amputation level, a more aggressive approach toward reconstruction in young patients seems appropriate. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of free flap reconstruction of a gangrenous defect in a Buerger patient.

PG  - 4946-7
AB  - Three patients with Buerger's disease, ischaemic ulcers and pain, accepted treatment with ilomedin, a synthetic stable prostaglandin, as a supplement to standard treatment. The patients were treated intravenously, with ilomedin for six hours daily for 28 days. One patient had total healing of his ulcers just after treatment. The ulcers of the other patients showed almost complete healing  about two months after treatment. However, the ulcers then returned to their previous size. Ilomedin was then used as preoperative treatment prior to amputation in order to facilitate healing after amputation. Our conclusions are that we now have a promising drug, ilomedin, in the treatment of patients with Buerger's disease, ulcers and pain, but controlled studies are necessary.

Buerger disease has been the main cause of chronic occlusive arterial disease before the middle of 1970s. and many patients suffered from intractable ischemic leg ulcer with severe pain. Reconstructive surgery, however, has been so much limited that number of the candidates for bypass surgery were around 10% of the patients, because of distal nature of the disease. We have developed a new technique in distal bypass surgery named as Esmarch's rubber bandage method, which was intended to minimize surgical injury to the host artery, and the results of its application to Buerger disease is very encouraging, and we have confirmed that this technique enables a bypass to the collateral arteries and muscular branches in place of the diseased tibio-peroneal artery. We expect this technique will clear a new avenue to surgical treatment of Buerger disease with limb threatening ischemia. In Takayasu's arteritis, the carotid reconstruction was popular between the late 1950s and 1960s and, at the same time atypical coarctation, renovascular hypertension, and aneurysm, along with their combined lesion became the objects of vascular surgery. This expansion of surgical indication contributed to the improvement of the prognosis and rehabilitation of the patients. Long term function of the reconstruction has been also confirmed. On the other hand, several problems emerged with the widespread application of vascular reconstruction which were peculiar to the disease state.  Among them, the most important problems were neurological complications due to sudden increase in the intracranial blood pressure after carotid reconstruction,  and anastomotic aneurysm as the delayed complication affecting eventual outcome which are inherent to the inflammation and extensive destruction of the medial component in this disease. A new method to prevent the postoperative neurological complications is discussed in this report. To improve the long term survival, meticulous observation of postoperative course is essential in Takayasu's arteritis. Recently, abdominal aortic aneurysms showing the peculiar gross appearance and clinical presentation have become the subject of discussion as inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm because of remarkable thickening of the aneurysmal wall and a severe inflammatory change, and some difficulties of its surgical treatment have been stressed in the most of the reports. The recent researches offered the conclusion that etiology of the aneurysm is not inflammation, but inflammatory reaction during formation of atherosclerotic aneurysm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

PG  - 2041-6
AB  - The method of angiography in vasculitis has recently been changed due to the development of digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Intra-venous DSA is widely  used in the diagnosis of vasculitis, although intra-arterial DSA is needed for depicting small vessel lesions. Low-osmolality contrast medium is another advancement in the angiography of vasculitis, which can make peripheral angiography painless. We discussed angiographic features in vasculitis diseases,  including Takayasu arteritis, Buerger disease, moyamoya disease, and vasculo-Behcet disease. Angiography is the most important in order to diagnose vasculitis and evaluate the degree and extent of disease. Further, interventional radiology, which uses the technic of angiography for the purpose of therapy, is employed for the vascular treatment of vasculitis.

TI  - [Histopathological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of intractable vasculitis syndromes].
PG  - 2034-40
AB  - Vasculitis has a simple definition--primary inflammation of the blood vessels, often with necrosis and occlusive changes--but its clinical manifestations are diverse and complex. In the absence of pathognomonic clinical features and laboratory tests, the diagnosis of vasculitis relies heavily on the correct interpretation of histologic changes but these too may not be specific in any given case. A positive biopsy is always helpful whereas a negative biopsy does not exclude the disease under consideration because the vasculitis may be focal and segmental in distribution, as in polyarteritis nodosa. Pathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of some of the major categories of systemic vasculitis were described; 1) polyarteritis nodosa; 2) Churg-Strauss syndrome; 3) hypersensitivity vasculitis; 4) Wegener's granulomatosis; 5) Kawasaki disease; 6) malignant rheumatoid arthritis; 7) systemic lupus erythematosus; 8) scleroderma;  9) polymyositis-dermatomyositis; 10) mixed connective tissue disease; 11) polyangiitis overlap syndrome; 12) giant cell arteritis; 13) Takayasu arteritis;  14) Behcet disease; 15) Buerger disease; and 16) inflammatory aortic aneurysm. Each of these major vasculitic syndromes has its own unique histopathologic features, but overlap still occurs.

PG  - 320-4
AB  - We report on the case of a 31-year-old male patient with focal testicular vasculitis as the only clinical manifestation of endangiitis obliterans (Winiwarter-Buerger disease), who presented with acute scrotal pain and swelling  suggestive of a testicular tumor. Doppler sonography revealed significantly increased vascularization at the borders of the lesion, which rather indicated a  vascular process; however, the presence of solid areas meant that the possibility of testicular cancer could not be excluded. Left inguinal orchiectomy was performed. The surgical specimen revealed histological patterns compatible with endangiitis obliterans; Raynaud phenomenon was the only sign of systemic disease, and no other organs were found to be affected. Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound/Doppler sonography, in the differential diagnosis of an unexplained testicular mass surgical exploration is still mandatory. The different types of focal vasculitis are described and discussed with reference to the literature.

AB  - The diagnosis of Buerger's disease, like that of all arteritis, especially in the onset phase, can be difficult. The general criteria proposed by several authors,  with the aim of codifying the verification of the disease, are sometimes too schematic and this collides with the existence of very variegated and polymorphous clinical situations, as well as totally atypical and unusual clinical patterns. On this subject we consider useful to report a case of Buerger's disease that presented some peculiar characteristics, the most important of which was the existence of an aneurysm of the left superficial temporal artery.

AB  - A retrospective analysis of 83 records of patients with Buerger's disease is presented. There were 71 men and 12 (14.5 percent) women. Compared with men, women with Buerger's disease had a significantly more frequent vasomotor disorder, but they had less trophic disorders and a lower risk of amputation. After a 42-month follow-up, it appeared that tobacco plays a major role in the prognosis: patients who continued to smoke had significantly more numerous acute  episodes than those who ceased smoking. The degree of intoxication is an element  of prognosis, but good medical management contributes to reduction in the number  of major amputations: only 5 patients (6 percent), all male, had a leg (4 cases)  or a thigh (1 case) amputated.

AB  - The diagnostic value was assessed of the examination of artery stenosis in lower  extremities by the Doppler method, and the results were compared with diagnosis made by means of arteriography, and intraoperatively. The analysis included 40 patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and Buerger disease. Ultrasonic normal values were determined for healthy arteries, and for insignificant and significant stenosis. Treating the intraoperative diagnosis as verifying the two  other methods it was found that the per cent of correct diagnosis was similar for ultrasonography and intraoperative examination, and was 76% and 66% respectively. The Doppler examination supplemented arteriography in the evaluation of crural arteries, while arteriography supplemented Doppler examination in the evaluation  of the deep femoral artery and the condition of collateral blood flow.

TI  - Ab-initio primitive cell parameters from single convergent-beam electron diffraction patterns: a converse route to the identification of microcrystals with electrons.
PG  - 158-65
AB  - A new method for the ab initio derivation of Buerger-reduced primitive cell parameters from coordinate measurements of spots on single convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns is described, which does not involve trial-and-error. The pattern can be taken along any zone axis, and misorientations of the crystallite by as much as a few degrees are taken into account without loss of accuracy. This derivation of cell parameters by least-squares analysis of the measurements has been automated in a program called NRCBED. Present accuracy is about 1% on lengths and 2 degrees on angles, but could be significantly improved by modelling projector lens aberrations, or by using a microscope without a projector lens. With present technology, it is possible to obtain a CBED pattern and a semi-quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis simultaneously from a single microcrystal a few hundred Angstroms  across. It becomes therefore possible to identify the material of the crystal on  a single CBED pattern: a cell parameter database for known compounds is searched  with the primitive cell parameters obtained in the above way, and with a mask describing the EDX results qualitatively. Feasibility is demonstrated on a crystallite of CeO2 500 Angstroms across. With this new approach, trial-and-error should disappear from the solution of other long-standing problems: interpretation of X-ray powder patterns for new compounds in the presence of impurity lines, or in the case of multiple phases should become straight-forward.

AB  - The authors relate their experience of thirty digital artery sympathectomies in twenty-four fingers. Ten men and two women were operated: six crush injuries to fingers, three Raynaud's disease and two Buerger disease and one scleroderma. All presented digital vascular insufficiency. The pre-operative arteriogram always revealed more extensive thrombosis than suspected by the clinical symptoms. In this way we performed a segmental arterial sympathectomy depending on the site of the thrombosed artery. The follow-up was five years. The immediate postoperative  results were excellent. Five years later the results depended on the nature of the initial disease.

TI  - Thromboangiitis obliterans: current perspectives and future directions.
PG  - 112-7
AB  - Originally described by von Winiwarter in 1879 and by Buerger in 1908, thromboangiitis obliterans became a focus of delayed controversy in the 1960s when its existence as a separate entity came into question. More recently, new information regarding the disease's pathogenesis, as well as a redefinition of its clinical and roentgenographic features, has given further credence to the theory that thromboangiitis obliterans is a distinct clinicopathologic and roentgenographic entity. By critically analyzing both old and new insights, this  article assesses the current status and future directions of the disease.

TI  - The embolic type of popliteal entrapment syndrome.
PG  - 63-7
AB  - The authors describe their experience with two patients who presented with clinical extremes of popliteal entrapment syndrome. One patient presented with acute ischemia and the second patient presented with a chronic Buergerian-like syndrome. The common denominator for both of them was embolic phenomena originating at the site of entrapment. Discussion is centered on pathogenesis of  the embolic phenomenon, prevalence of distal arterial degradation and its clinical manifestation. The clue for differentiation from true Buerger disease is the angiographic pattern demonstrating apparently healthy distal arterial segments, confirmed by mandatory arterial biopsy. It is emphasized that in cases  having acute embolic presentation the primary pathology should be treated concomitantly to revascularization.

TI  - Significance of Buerger's test in the assessment of lower limb ischaemia.
PG  - 729-31
AB  - In claudicants with arteriosclerosis obliterans admitted for vascular surgery, Buerger's test was compared with other indicators of lower limb ischaemia. Rest pain, gangrene, trophic changes, and chronic erythromelia were significantly commoner and more distal pulses were absent in Buerger positive limbs. Doppler and transcutaneous oxygen pressures and indices were significantly lower in Buerger positive legs. Significantly more occlusions were noted on arteriography  in arteries distal to the adductor hiatus in the Buerger positive group. Buerger's test is a useful adjunct to routine peripheral vascular assessment and, if positive, suggests more severe ischaemia with distal limb artery involvement.

TI  - Screened precession method for area detectors.
PG  - 183-7
AB  - A method is presented in which the features of a Buerger-type mechanical precession camera can be simulated using an electronic area detector and a three-circle automated goniostat. The resulting display as viewed on a video monitor is very much like a conventional precession photograph. The detector is stationary which causes a distortion that is negligible for precession angles less than 10 degrees. The virtue of this new method is that a precession image may be collected very fast and the intensities of the reflections when displayed  are already digitized. The usefulness of these features is presented through two  familiar tasks: the determination of a new protein crystal space group and the evaluation of a heavy-atom derivative.

AB  - In a group of 1621 patients with vascular brain lesions (849 males, 772 females)  the authors found seizures in 108 cases (56 males, 52 females): in 26 cases of subarachnoid haemorrhage (aneurysms), 6 cerebral haemorrhages, 24 cerebral arterial thromboses, 18 atherosclerosis of brain vessels, 13 cases of embolia, 4  cases of transient cerebral ischaemia, 4 cases of vertebrobasilar insufficiency,  4 cases of cerebrocardiac syndromes, 2 cases of cerebral form of the Winiwarter-Buerger disease and 1 cases each of cerebellar haemorrhage and aortic  arch syndrome. In 8 cases family history of epilepsy was elicited. The authors suggest administration of anticonvulsants in justified cases.

AB  - Arteriographic appearances suggestive of Buerger's disease may be seen in patients considerably beyond the usual age of onset of the disease. Eliminating cases possibly resulting from an embolic process and diabetics, 9 patients were evaluated in the present study. Combined review of arteriographic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histological data led to the identification of 3 patient groups: Buerger's disease with ageing: 3 cases, intermediate or transitional forms: 4 cases, Finally, certain cases of arterial disease related to cold damage should be viewed in the context of the preceding forms: 2 cases.

AB  - The authors report two observations of T.A.O. placed under the heading of "Systems Affections" after the discovery of immunologic abnormalities. Vascular troubles in L.E.A.D. and generalised sclerodermis are, apart from the Raynaud Syndrom, exceptional. They oriente specially towards a T.A.O., and in absence of  caracteristic symptoms, they retard the diagnosis of a connective. The reader is  reminded of the characteristics of the "Buerger Affection" which must no longer be considered as unique anatomoclinic entity, due to modern immunologic and phlebologic exams.

TI  - Winiwarter-Buerger disease ('thromboangiitis obliterans') with cerebral involvement.
PG  - 1870-2
AB  - A patient with clinical and radiological manifestations o Winiwarter-Buerger disease ("thromboangiitis obliterans") in the extremities had three cerebrovascular events during a five-year follow-up. Changes of infarction were confirmed by computed tomographic brain scan and arteriography, but no clinical or laboratory evidence of vasculitis nor a source of recurrent emboli could be found. He had no atherosclerotic risk factors except being a heavy smoker. Cerebrovascular involvement in Buerger's disease is infrequent, but clinical and  pathological demonstration has occasionally been found. The existence of Buerger's disease has been questioned, but there appears to be a distinct syndrome of vascular disease that is not atherosclerotic or vasculitic. Stroke maybe a component of this syndrome and may be a complication preventable by cessation of smoking.

TI  - Digital ischemia: angiographic differentiation of embolism from primary arterial  disease.
PG  - 1183-7
AB  - Embolic disease is often overlooked as a cause of digital ischemia. Unilateral symptoms, in particular, should suggest the possibility of emboli arising from the subclavian or more distal upper extremity vessels. Emboli may originate in the subclavian artery as the result of atherosclerosis at its origin or arterial  injury secondary to thoracic outlet compression. Arteriography can be useful in the identification of upper extremity emboli and their source, and should include studies of the aortic arch, proximal subclavian artery, and digital arteries. Retrograde subclavian injections may be required to adequately demonstrate the origin of the subclavian artery. Magnification technique is often essential in differentiating small digital artery emboli from primary arterial diseases, such  as Buerger disease or scleroderma.

PG  - 35-7
AB  - The new compounds such as Prazosin are antihypertensive agents. Their action on blood pressure are a consequence of a direct action on vascular smooth muscle with little or no effect on cardiac output. This action is very important to reduce total peripheral resistance. In our Vascular Laboratory, we study 14 patients treated by Prazosin. They were all studied by capillaroscopy, ultrasonic investigations and plethysmography. Since Prazosin is primarily an alpha receptor blocker, it might be expected to have an action in microcirculation and in vasospastic diseases. We don't find modifications of microcirculation in seven people treated for hypertensive disease. Among seven patients with Raynaud phenomenon, we have only a good result in one case (Buerger disease) and two cases with a little increase of the fingertips blood flow.

TI  - Buerger's syndrome.
PG  - 713-6
AB  - All cases diagnosed as Buerger's disease at The Mount Sinai Hospital from 1933-1963 have been reviewed. A large majority were found to have well-known vascular problems other than what we now consider as Buerger's disease. Only two  specimens from 33 amputations had the characteristic histologic findings that Buerger described. It is suggested that the terminology Buerger's disease be replaced by Buerger's syndrome. In 1908, while at The Mount Sinai Hospital, Dr. Leo Buerger described a clinical entity with its histologic counterpart that soon became known as "Buerger's disease." The clinical picture was essentially that of arterial insufficiency, mainly in the lower extremities, in a young, Jewish, adult male who smoked. It was frequently associated with a migrating thrombophlebitis. The histologic picture was not as clearly defined but was stated to differ from arteriosclerosis in that normal vessel was found proximal and distal to the lesion, canalization of the occlusive lesion occurred, capillary ingrowth was present in the media, and there was an absence of elastic  tissue in the organizing process. It should be noted that most of Buerger's specimens consisted of veins removed during an episode of acute thrombophlebitis. He specifically stated that only in the early stages of the disease, when phlebitis was the main finding, could the lesion be separated from the various stages of arteriosclerosis. In recent years, doubt has been cast on the existence of the clinical or pathological picture described by Buerger. Accordingly, it was thought advisable to review the case records and pathologic specimens of patients discharged from The Mount Sinai Hospital with the diagnosis of Buerger's disease  over a recent 30-year period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
